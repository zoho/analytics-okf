# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{formula-id}` | string | ID of the formula. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#formula-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `childViews` | Array | Reports, charts, and pivot tables (non-dashboard views) that use this aggregate formula. Empty array if none. |
| `childViews[].viewId` | String | ID of the dependent view. |
| `childViews[].viewName` | String | Display name of the dependent view. |
| `childViews[].viewType` | String | Human-readable view type, e.g., `"Chart View"`, `"Pivot View"`. |
| `childViews[].viewTypeId` | Integer | Numeric view type ID (see [Common `viewTypeId` Values](#common-viewtypeid-values) below). |
| `parentTables` | Array | The base table(s) this aggregate formula is computed from (i.e., the table referenced in the `expression`). Typically contains a single entry — the owning table — but may include additional linked tables for cross-table aggregates. |
| `parentTables[].viewId` / `viewName` / `viewType` / `viewTypeId` | String / String / String / Integer | Same structure as `childViews`, but describing the source table rather than a dependent. |
| `aggregateFormulas` | Array | Other aggregate formulas that reference this one in their own expression (formula-on-formula dependencies). Empty array if none. |
| `aggregateFormulas[].formulaId` / `formulaName` | String / String | ID and name of the dependent aggregate formula. |
| `childDashboards` | Array | Dashboards (including tabbed dashboards) that include a widget referencing this formula. Empty array if none. |
| `childDashboards[].viewId` / `viewName` / `viewType` / `viewTypeId` | String / String / String / Integer | Standard view identification fields for the dashboard. |
| `childDashboards[].tabIds` | Array of String | **Only present when `viewType` is `"Tab"`** (a tabbed dashboard container). Lists the IDs of the individual dashboard tabs that use this formula. |

### Common `viewTypeId` Values

| `viewTypeId` | `viewType` |
|--------------|------------|
| `0` | Table |
| `2` | Chart View |
| `3` | Pivot View |
| `7` | Dashboard |
| `9` | Tab (tabbed dashboard container) |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- Always call this API before the Delete Aggregate Formula API. The childViews, childDashboards and aggregateFormulas arrays together represent everything that would be removed by setting deleteDependentViews to true.
- parentTables describes what the formula is built from rather than what depends on it, which makes it useful for understanding the lineage of a metric before its expression is changed. No other dependents API in this suite returns lineage information.
- Several tabs of the same tabbed dashboard that use the metric are consolidated into a single childDashboards entry whose view type is Tab, carrying a tabIds array, rather than one entry per tab.
- Obtain the formula-id from the Get Unified Metrics in Workspace API or from the view-scoped Get Aggregate Formula API.

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Get dependents of an aggregate formula used in a dashboard**

```http

```

**Case 2 — Get dependents of a formula with no dependents (safe to delete)**

```http
GET /restapi/v2/workspaces/137687000271334001/aggregateformulas/137687000112449600/dependents HTTP/1.1

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Get Aggregate Formula Dependents](../../../sdk-examples/data-modeling-and-schema/aggregate-formulas/get-aggregate-formula-dependents.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Always call before Delete Aggregate Formula** | The `childViews`, `childDashboards`, and `aggregateFormulas` arrays together represent everything that would be affected by `deleteDependentViews: true` on the Delete Aggregate Formula API. |
| **`parentTables` shows lineage, not dependents** | This is the only field in the response describing what the formula is built *from*, rather than what depends *on* it. Useful for understanding a formula's data lineage before editing its expression. |
| **Tabbed dashboards are consolidated** | Multiple tabs within the same tabbed dashboard that all use the formula are reported as a single `childDashboards` entry with `viewType: "Tab"` and a `tabIds` array, rather than one entry per tab. |
| **Dependency** | `<formula-id>` → Get Unified Metrics in Workspace or the view-scoped Get Aggregate Formula. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | User does not have permission. | Ensure the user is a Workspace Admin or has Read permission on the workspace. |
| [7428](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7428) | 400 | The specified `<formula-id>` is not a valid aggregate formula, or does not belong to a view in this workspace. | Verify `<formula-id>` using Get Unified Metrics in Workspace. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | The OAuth access token is missing, expired, revoked, or does not carry the scope required by this operation. | Regenerate the access token with the required scope (see the endpoint document) and retry. |
