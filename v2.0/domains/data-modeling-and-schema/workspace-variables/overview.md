# Summary

This document covers the APIs for creating, editing, deleting, and retrieving **workspace variables** — reusable placeholders (e.g., `${Region}`, `${Target Sales}`) that can be embedded in formula expressions, SQL queries, filters, and reports. Variables allow the same report/formula definition to resolve to different values per user (or per Client Portal domain), without duplicating the underlying view.

APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving workspace variables.

# Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Operation ID | OAuth scope | Success |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Create Variable](create-variable.md) | POST | `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/variables` | `createVariable` | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.create` | 200 |
| [Edit Variable](update-variable.md) | PUT | `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/variables/{variable-id}` | `updateVariable` | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.update` | 204 |
| [Delete Variable](delete-variable.md) | DELETE | `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/variables/{variable-id}` | `deleteVariable` | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.delete` | 204 |
| [Get Variables](get-variables.md) | GET | `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/variables` | `getVariables` | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.read` | 200 |
| [Get Variable Details](get-variable-details.md) | GET | `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/variables/{variable-id}` | `getVariableDetails` | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.read` | 200 |

All endpoints require the `Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` header (see [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md)) and, unless stated otherwise in the endpoint document, the `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header (see [Request conventions](../../../foundations/request-conventions.md)).

# What is a Workspace Variable?

A variable is defined once at the workspace level with a name, a data type, and a **type** that determines how its value is resolved:

- **List** — the variable resolves to one value picked from a fixed list of allowed values, with a default value.
- **Range** — the variable resolves to a numeric value within a min/max bound, incremented by a step size, with a default value.
- **All Values** — a special type with no explicit values; it always represents "every possible value" (used chiefly as a placeholder default with no per-user override).

Each variable can additionally carry **per-user (or per-portal-domain) overrides** — different sets of allowed values, ranges, and defaults for specific email addresses — falling back to a workspace-wide `defaultData` definition for any user not explicitly listed.

# API-Specific Notes and Behaviours

## Create Variable

- **Permission is stricter than most modeling APIs in this documentation suite.** There is no permission-based alternative here (e.g., no "Create Formula"/"Design Modify" option) — only Account Admin, Organization Admin, or Workspace Admin roles can create variables. Regular users with granular permissions cannot.
- **`variableType` and `variableDataType` together gate what fields are valid.** Always cross-check the [Variable Type Values](create-variable.md#variable-type-values) and [Variable Data Type Values](create-variable.md#variable-data-type-values) tables before constructing a request — an otherwise well-formed request fails outright if the combination is invalid (e.g., Range + Text).
- **Dependency chain:** Get Workspace List → Create Variable → `variableId` returned in response → reference the variable by name (`${variableName}`) in formulas/filters/SQL.

## Edit Variable

- **This is a full-replace API, not a patch API** — the exact same behavior pattern as [Edit Query Table](../query-tables/edit-query-table.md), which also requires resending the complete definition. Always fetch the current definition via Get Variable Details first, modify only the fields you intend to change, then resend the full CONFIG.
- **Uniquely among the Edit APIs in this documentation suite, this one supports changing the fundamental "shape" of the object** (`variableType` and `variableDataType`) rather than just its name/values — but doing so is blocked (error 70358) if existing formulas/reports depend on the variable in a way incompatible with the new shape.
- **Dependency chain:** Get Variable Details (fetch current state) → Edit Variable (resend full, modified CONFIG).

## Delete Variable

- **No dedicated "Get Variable Dependents" API exists in this suite**, unlike columns and aggregate formulas which both have their own dependents-lookup endpoints. To determine what references a variable before deleting it, review formula expressions (via [Get Custom Formulas](../formula-columns/get-custom-formula-list.md) / [Get Aggregate Formula](../aggregate-formulas/get-aggregate-formula-list.md)) and report/query definitions for `${variableName}` references manually.
- **No cascade-delete flag** — this is a deliberate difference from Delete Column/Delete Aggregate Formula's `deleteDependentViews` option; dependent objects must always be updated or removed manually first.
- **Dependency chain:** Get Variables → (manually verify no formula/report references exist) → Delete Variable.

## Get Variables

- **Lightweight listing, integer-as-string fields.** Use this for building selection UIs or inventories; switch to Get Variable Details only when the full value set is needed, since `variableType`/`variableDataType` here are strings rather than integers.
- **Dependency chain:** Get Workspace List → Get Variables → `variableId` feeds into Get Variable Details / Edit / Delete Variable.

## Get Variable Details

- **The most detailed "read" response in this API family** — includes conditional per-type fields (`values` vs. `minValue`/`maxValue`/`stepSize`) and an optional top-level `defaultData` object that may be entirely absent for All Values-type variables.
- **Always branch your parsing logic on `variableType` first**, then on `variableDataType` for format-specific fields, since the shape of `defaultData`/`userSpecificData` entries and `format` both depend on these two enums.
- **Dependency chain:** Get Variables (`variableId`) → Get Variable Details.

# General Response Payload Notes

| Field / Behaviour | Detail |
|-------------------|--------|
| **`variableType`/`variableDataType` type inconsistency across read APIs** | Get Variables returns these as strings (`"0"`, `"1"`); Get Variable Details returns them as native integers (`0`, `1`). This is the most important cross-API parsing note in this document — do not assume consistent JSON types for the same logical field across different endpoints. |
| **All numeric variable values are transmitted as strings** | `values`, `minValue`, `maxValue`, `stepSize`, and `defaultValue` are always JSON strings in both requests and responses, regardless of the variable's numeric `variableDataType` — this preserves precision for large/decimal numbers. |
| **`defaultData` presence is conditional on `variableType`** | Only List (`0`) and Range (`1`) type variables have a `defaultData` object; All Values (`3`) type variables omit it entirely, both in requests (it is ignored/rejected if sent) and in Get Variable Details responses. |
| **Empty response bodies are common for mutating calls** | Edit Variable and Delete Variable both return HTTP **204 No Content** with no JSON body at all — treat the 2xx status code as the success indicator, not the presence/absence of a `status` field. |
| **Variables are referenced by name, not ID, in downstream APIs** | Unlike columns or formulas (referenced by ID in dependents/value APIs), workspace variables are referenced inside formula expressions and SQL queries using their `variableName` wrapped in `${...}` syntax — the `variableId` returned by these APIs is only used for managing the variable definition itself (Edit/Delete/Get Details), not for embedding it elsewhere. |
