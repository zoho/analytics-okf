# Summary

**GET `/restapi/v2/bulk/workspaces/{workspace-id}/exportjobs/{job-id}/data`** - Download Exported Data (Asynchronous Data Export / Data Operations).

Returns the exported file produced by a completed export job.

**Path parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `<workspace-id>` | Long | ID of the workspace the job was created against. |
| `<job-id>` | Long | The `data.jobId` returned by either creation API. |

This endpoint is exactly what `data.downloadUrl` from [Get Export Job Details](get-export-job-details.md) points at.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Download the file produced by a completed asynchronous export job. The job must have reached jobCode 1004; calling earlier fails with 8121 (queued) or 8122 (running), and 8123 if the job failed. Only the user who created the job may download it.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.data.read`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{job-id}` | string | The unique identifier of the import/export job. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#job-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

The exported file is available only for one hour after the export job completes.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `text/csv`, `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/vnd.ms-excel`, `application/pdf`, `text/html`, `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `application/zip`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

The success body is a file, not a JSON envelope, so structured fields exist only for the JSON and XML formats. They are identical to the synchronous export's — see [Response Fields](../sync-data-export/export-data-view.md#response-fields) there for the full field tables of all four shapes.

**Response headers**

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | The only header that describes the payload. Derived from the job's `responseFormat`, or `application/zip` when the file was archived — see [Exported File Structure by Format](#exported-file-structure-by-format). |
| `Content-Disposition` | **Not sent.** No filename is suggested, so the client must name the downloaded file itself. |

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — collect the file**

```http
GET /restapi/v2/bulk/workspaces/466206000000071000/exportjobs/466206000000091000/data HTTP/1.1

  }
}
```

**HTTP 400 Bad Request — the job failed**

```json

  "status": "failure",
  "summary": "EXPORT_JOB_ERROR_OCCURRED",
  "data": {
    "errorCode": 8123,
    "errorMessage": "An internal error occurred while processing the job 466206000000091000. Kindly contact our support team."
  }
}
```

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Download Exported Data](../../../sdk-examples/data-operations/async-data-export/download-exported-data.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Behaviour | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **The response body is the file, not a wrapper** | A successful call returns no `status` / `summary` / `data` envelope. Only **failures** use the JSON envelope, so branch on the HTTP status before parsing. |
| **It never waits** | Calling before the job has finished is an error, not a blocking read: `8121` while queued, `8122` while running, `8123` if the job failed. Poll [Get Export Job Details](get-export-job-details.md) first. |
| **Each error code names a distinct job state** | `8121` queued, `8122` running, `8123` failed, `8120` absent or expired, `8124` not yours. They map one-to-one onto `jobCode`, so the download error alone is enough to decide whether to retry. |
| **The file can be downloaded more than once** | Within the 72-hour window there is no single-use restriction and no state change on download. |
| **After 72 hours the job is gone** | The record and the file are removed together, and this endpoint then fails with `8120`. |
| **No `Content-Disposition`, no filename** | Derive one from the view or query and the format, and remember that a password-protected `csv` arrives as a ZIP. |
| **Only the creator may download** | Even an Account Admin gets `8124` for another user's job — see [Permission Model](overview.md#permission-model). |
| **`downloadUrl` and this endpoint are the same thing** | Following the URL from [Get Export Job Details](get-export-job-details.md) and constructing the path yourself are equivalent. |
| **Dependency chain:** | [Get Export Job Details](get-export-job-details.md) → `jobCode` `1004` → Download Exported Data → the file. |

## Exported File Structure by Format

The file returned here is byte-for-byte what the [synchronous export](../sync-data-export/export-data-view.md#response-structure-by-format) would have produced for the same CONFIG.

| Job `responseFormat` | `Content-Type` | Body |
|----------------------|----------------|------|
| `csv` | `text/csv` | Delimited text. Optional header row, optional leading `Row Number` field. |
| `json` (`keyValueFormat: true`) | `application/json` | `{"data":[ {…}, … ]}` — one object per row, keyed by column display name. |
| `json` (`keyValueFormat: false`) | `application/json` | `{"response":{"uri":…,"action":"EXPORT","result":{"column_order":[…],"rows":[[…]]}}}` |
| `xml` (`keyValueFormat: false`) | `application/xml` | `<?xml …?><response …><result><rows><row><column name="…">…</column></row></rows></result></response>` |
| `xml` (`keyValueFormat: true`) | `application/xml` | `<result><rows><row><ColumnName>…</ColumnName></row></rows></result>` — no XML declaration and no `<response>` wrapper. |
| `xls` | `application/vnd.ms-excel` | Binary workbook. |
| `pdf` | `application/pdf` | Binary PDF. |
| `html` | `text/html` | An HTML fragment containing the rendered table. |
| `image` | `image/png` or `image/jpeg` | Binary image. |
| **any format with `password`** | `application/zip`, or the native type for `xls` and `pdf` | See [Password Protection](overview.md#password-protection). |
| **a dashboard as `html`** | `application/zip` | One HTML file per view in the dashboard. |
| **a multi-tab dashboard as `pdf`** | `application/zip` | One PDF per tab. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [8120](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8120) | 404 | `EXPORT_JOB_NOT_FOUND` — No export job exists for the given ID, or it has passed its 72-hour retention (HTTP 404). | Verify the `jobId`; if it has expired, create a new job. |
| [8121](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8121) | 400 | `EXPORT_JOB_NOT_INITIATED` — The job is queued but has not started (`jobCode` `1001`). | Poll [Get Export Job Details](get-export-job-details.md) until `jobCode` is `1004`. |
| [8122](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8122) | 400 | `EXPORT_JOB_NOT_COMPLETED` — The job is still running (`jobCode` `1002`). | Poll [Get Export Job Details](get-export-job-details.md) until `jobCode` is `1004`. |
| [8123](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8123) | 400 | `EXPORT_JOB_ERROR_OCCURRED` — The job failed (`jobCode` `1003`). | Nothing to download. Create a new job; if the failure repeats, contact support. |
| [8124](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8124) | 403 | `EXPORT_JOB_ACCESS_DENIED` — The caller did not create this job (HTTP 403). | Download with the same user that created the job. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | `INVALID_OAUTHTOKEN` — Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.data.read`. |
