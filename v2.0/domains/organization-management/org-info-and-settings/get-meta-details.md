# Summary

**GET `/restapi/v2/metadetails`** - Get Meta Details From Name (Organization Info & Settings / Organization Management).

Resolves a workspace (and optionally a view) **by name** to return its numeric IDs. This is useful when you know the human-readable names of a workspace and view but need their IDs to call other workspace-scoped or view-scoped APIs.

- When only `workspaceName` is provided: returns the workspace ID, description, and org ID.
- When both `workspaceName` and `viewName` are provided: additionally returns the view's ID, description, and type.

> **Name uniqueness:** Workspace names are unique within an organisation. View names are unique within a workspace. This API performs an exact, case-sensitive match on the provided names.

# Endpoint

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Operation ID | `getMetaDetails` |
| HTTP method | GET |
| URL | `/restapi/v2/metadetails` |
| Base URL | `https://analyticsapi.zoho.com` (data-center specific, see [Data centers](../../../foundations/data-centers.md)) |
| OAuth scope | [`ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read`](../../../foundations/oauth-scopes.md#zohoanalyticsmetadataread) |
| ZANALYTICS-ORGID header | **Required** - Organisation ID in which the workspace exists. |
| Permission required | The authenticated user must have at least Read access on the specified workspace (for workspace-only lookup), or Read access on the specific view (for view lookup). Workspace Admins, Account Admins, Organization Admins, and any user with at least one shared view in the workspace can call this API. See [Roles & permissions](../../../foundations/roles-and-permissions.md). |
| CONFIG parameter | JSON object sent as the URL-encoded `CONFIG` query parameter - **mandatory** |
| Success response | HTTP 200 - `application/json` |
| OpenAPI | [`org-management-grouped-api.json`](../../../references/openapi/org-management-grouped-api.json) - pointer `#/paths/~1restapi~1v2~1metadetails/get`; CONFIG schema `GetMetaDetailsConfig`; response schema `GetMetaDetailsResponse` |

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

This endpoint has no path parameters.

## CONFIG Parameter

CONFIG is **mandatory** for this API. It must be sent as a query parameter named `CONFIG`.

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `workspaceName` | String | **Yes** | — | The exact display name of the workspace to look up. Must match the workspace name as it appears in the Zoho Analytics UI, including case. Maximum length: 50 characters. |
| `viewName` | String | No | — | The exact display name of a view within the workspace. When provided, the response additionally includes the view's ID, type, and description. When omitted, only workspace information is returned. Maximum length: 50 characters. |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- Workspace names are unique within an organisation and view names are unique within a workspace. The match is exact and case sensitive, so `Sales Analytics` and `sales analytics` are treated as different names.
- The lookup is scoped to the organisation sent in the `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header. A workspace of the same name in a different organisation is not found, and the request fails with error code 7104.
- When `viewName` is sent and the view does not exist in the workspace, the request fails with error code 7104. Workspace metadata is not returned in failure responses.
- When `viewName` is sent, permission is checked against the view. If the view is not accessible to the user, the request fails with error code 7301 even when the user can see the workspace.
- A workspace-only lookup succeeds only when at least one view in the workspace is shared with the user. If the workspace holds views but none are shared with the user, the request fails with error code 7301.
- This API is the recommended way to bootstrap name-based integrations. Resolve `workspaceId` and `viewId` here and pass them to downstream APIs, instead of hard-coding numeric IDs that can change across environments.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `data.workspaces.workspaceId` | String | Numeric ID of the workspace. Use this as `<workspace-id>` in workspace-scoped API URLs. |
| `data.workspaces.workspaceName` | String | Display name of the workspace (echoed from the request). |
| `data.workspaces.workspaceDesc` | String | Description of the workspace. Empty string if not set. |
| `data.workspaces.orgId` | String | Organisation ID that owns this workspace. |
| `data.views` | Object | Present only when `viewName` was included in the request. |
| `data.views.viewId` | String | Numeric ID of the view. Use this as `<view-id>` in view-scoped API URLs. |
| `data.views.viewName` | String | Display name of the view (echoed from the request). |
| `data.views.viewDesc` | String | Description of the view. Empty string if not set. |
| `data.views.viewType` | String | Type of the view (e.g., `"Table"`, `"AnalysisView"`, `"Pivot"`, `"SummaryView"`, `"Query Table"`, `"Dashboard"`). |
