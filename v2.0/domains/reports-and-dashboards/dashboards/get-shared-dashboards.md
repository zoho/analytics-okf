# Summary

**GET `/restapi/v2/dashboards/shared`** - Get Shared Dashboards (Dashboards / Reports & Dashboards).

> This API has no request body parameters. All context is derived from the OAuth token.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Returns all dashboards that have been shared with the authenticated user across every organization and workspace, as a single `views` array. Unlike Get All Dashboards, this endpoint returns only shared dashboards, and it is also available on custom domains.

This API has no request parameters; all context is derived from the OAuth token. The authenticated user may be any active Zoho Analytics user.
