# Summary

This document describes the V2 **Dashboards** REST APIs of Zoho Analytics — covering dashboard listing, creation, metadata retrieval, and updates.
APIs are documented with URL, method, OAuth scope, permissions, sample requests/responses, and error codes.

> Notes that apply to every API in this document:
> - All requests are authenticated via OAuth (`Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken <token>`).
> - `ZohoAnalytics_Server_URI` depends on the data center (`analyticsapi.zoho.com`, `.eu`, etc.).
> - **Get All Dashboards, Get Owned Dashboards, and Get Shared Dashboards** (the listing APIs) operate at the **user service level** — they return dashboards across all organizations the caller belongs to. No `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header is required.
> - **Create Dashboard, Get Dashboard Metadata, and Update Dashboard** (the workspace-scoped APIs) operate on a specific workspace. The `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header is **mandatory**.
> - The three listing APIs are user-scoped — the OAuth token must be issued with user-level scope.
> - Get All Dashboards and Get Owned Dashboards are disabled on custom domains. Get Shared Dashboards works on custom domains. The three workspace-scoped APIs are accessible on custom domains, subject to permission checks.

---

APIs for listing dashboards accessible to a user, and for creating, reading and updating dashboards inside a workspace.

The module splits into two families that behave differently.

- **Listing APIs** - Get All Dashboards, Get Owned Dashboards and Get Shared Dashboards. These operate at user service level and return dashboards across every organization the caller belongs to. No `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header is needed, and the OAuth token must be issued with user level scope.
- **Workspace-scoped APIs** - Create Dashboard, Get Dashboard Metadata and Update Dashboard. These operate on one workspace and require the `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header.

## Common request conventions

| Header | Value | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <oauth-token>` | Mandatory for every API |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | Organization ID owning the workspace | Workspace-scoped APIs only |
| `Content-Type` | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Create and Update only |

Get Shared Dashboards works on custom domains. Get All Dashboards and Get Owned Dashboards are disabled on custom domains. The workspace-scoped APIs are reachable on custom domains subject to additional permission checks.

## OAuth scopes

| API | Method | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Get All Dashboards | GET | `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read` |
| Get Owned Dashboards | GET | `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read` |
| Get Shared Dashboards | GET | `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read` |
| Create Dashboard | POST | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.create` |
| Get Dashboard Metadata | GET | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.read` |
| Update Dashboard | PUT | `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.update` |

## Response envelope

- **status** - `success` or `failure`.
- **summary** - human readable description of the completed operation.
- **data.ownedViews** and **data.sharedViews** - Get All Dashboards only.
- **data.views** - Get Owned Dashboards and Get Shared Dashboards; a single list, owned-only or shared-only depending on the endpoint.
- **data.dashboardId** and **data.displayName** - Create Dashboard only.
- **data.dashboardConfig** - Get Dashboard Metadata only.

`viewId`, `workspaceId` and `orgId` are returned as strings even though the underlying values are long integers. `createdTime` and `lastModifiedTime` are epoch timestamps in milliseconds, as strings - divide by 1000 for epoch seconds. `sharedBy` is present on every entry, empty in owned items and populated with an email in shared ones. `isFavorite` is user specific and reflects the requesting user.

`dashboardConfig.objId`, `data.dashboardId` and `viewId` are the same value under three different names.

## Update replaces sections wholesale

Update Dashboard does not merge. When `layout`, `themes` or `settings` is included, every stored row for that section is deleted and exactly what was sent is stored in its place. Sending `{"settings":{"enableGlobalUF":"true"}}` reverts every other setting to its system default. A section left out of the CONFIG is not touched.

**Read-modify-write**

1. `GET .../metadata?CONFIG={"include":"settings"}` to fetch just the section being changed.
2. Merge the change into the returned object, keeping every key that came back.
3. `PUT` the complete section.

**Adding a layout card without losing the others**

The layout is a complete card map keyed by index string. Fetch it with `include=layout`, append the new card under the next sequential key, and PUT the whole map back.

**Cloning a dashboard**

Fetch the full metadata, take `layout`, `themes` and `settings` from `dashboardConfig`, drop `objId`, `displayName` and `description` (they are read-only in the response and are not valid Create CONFIG fields other than `displayName`/`description`, which must be supplied fresh), then POST with a new `displayName`. The `viewName` values inside `layout` must match views that exist in the target workspace.

## Behaviour worth knowing before the first call

| Case | Behaviour | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Partial `settings` on Update | Only the keys sent are stored; the rest revert to defaults. | Send the full settings object fetched via GET. |
| Section omitted on Update | Left unchanged. | Include only the sections being replaced. |
| `layoutType` grid preset (1-4) | The server auto-injects a USERFILTERS card at index `"1"` and rearranges view cards into columns, renumbering the input. | Omit `layoutType`, or send 0, for free form layouts; confirm with a GET afterwards. |
| `viewName` in a layout card | Identifies an analysis view by display name, not ID. A renamed or deleted view renders as a broken card. | Verify view names through the Reports APIs first. |
| Resetting the theme | `{"themes":{"default":"true"}}` clears all theme customization in one call. | Use it to undo theme changes without knowing the original values. |
| Tabbed dashboards | Get Dashboard Metadata and Update Dashboard fail with error 8102. | Check the dashboard type first. |
| `include` with several sections | `include=themes,layout` returns both sections but omits `objId`, `displayName` and `description`. | Use `include=all` when identity fields are needed, such as for clone workflows. |
| Scalar types in the response | Theme and settings scalars come back as strings even where the CONFIG accepts numbers. | Coerce before comparing, and send back the form the CONFIG documents. |

# Working with Get, Create, and Update Together

## Why Get Dashboard Metadata Before Update

The **Update Dashboard** API performs a **full section replacement** — not a merge. When you include `layout`, `themes`, or `settings` in an Update request, the server:

1. Deletes **all** stored rows for that section
2. Stores exactly what you sent

If you only send `{"settings": {"enableGlobalUF": "true"}}`, every other setting reverts to the system default. To avoid unintended data loss, always **fetch first, modify, then update**.

---

## Workflow 1 — Read-Modify-Write (Safe Update)

**Step 1: Fetch only the section you need to change**

Use `include` to avoid fetching the full config when you only need one section:

```http
GET /restapi/v2/workspaces/320873000000001001/dashboards/320873000000597763/metadata?CONFIG={"include":"settings"}
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 320873000000000001
```

Response — only the stored (non-default) settings are returned:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "dashboardConfig": {
      "settings": {
        "smartAlignCharts": "true",
        "fitToWidth": "true",
        "allowDrillDown": "true",
        "allowExport": { "pdf": "true", "excel": "true", "csv": "true", "html": "true", "image": "true", "zohoSheet": "true" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Modify the desired key(s) in the returned object**

Add `enableGlobalUF` to the settings object from the response:

```json
{
  "smartAlignCharts": "true",
  "fitToWidth": "true",
  "allowDrillDown": "true",
  "enableGlobalUF": "true",
  "allowExport": { "pdf": "true", "excel": "true", "csv": "true", "html": "true", "image": "true", "zohoSheet": "true" }
}
```

**Step 3: Send the complete modified object in the Update**

```http
PUT /restapi/v2/workspaces/320873000000001001/dashboards/320873000000597763
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 320873000000000001
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={"settings":{"smartAlignCharts":"true","fitToWidth":"true","allowDrillDown":"true","enableGlobalUF":"true","allowExport":{"pdf":"true","excel":"true","csv":"true","html":"true","image":"true","zohoSheet":"true"}}}
```

> Apply the same pattern for `themes` and `layout` — always send the full section back, not just the changed keys.

---

## Workflow 2 — Layout Update Without Losing Cards

The layout is a complete card map. Sending a partial layout (e.g., only 2 cards) replaces the entire layout with those 2 cards. To add a card without removing others:

**Step 1: Fetch the current layout**

```http
GET .../metadata?CONFIG={"include":"layout"}
```

**Step 2: Append the new card to the returned layout object**

The card index key must be the next sequential number. Existing card indices from the GET response are preserved:

```json
{
  "1": { "type": "USERFILTERS", "width": 80, "height": 3, "left": 0, "top": 0 },
  "2": { "type": "VIEW", "width": 40, "height": 20, "left": 0, "top": 3, "viewName": "Sales_Report" },
  "3": { "type": "VIEW", "width": 40, "height": 20, "left": 40, "top": 3, "viewName": "Revenue_Chart" }
}
```

**Step 3: PUT the full layout back**

```http
PUT .../dashboards/320873000000597763
...
CONFIG={"layout":{"1":{"type":"USERFILTERS","width":80,"height":3,"left":0,"top":0},"2":{"type":"VIEW","width":40,"height":20,"left":0,"top":3,"viewName":"Sales_Report"},"3":{"type":"VIEW","width":40,"height":20,"left":40,"top":3,"viewName":"Revenue_Chart"}}}
```

---

## Workflow 3 — Cloning a Dashboard (Get → Create)

Use the full metadata of an existing dashboard as a template for a new one:

**Step 1: Fetch full metadata of the source dashboard**

```http
GET /restapi/v2/workspaces/320873000000001001/dashboards/320873000000597763/metadata
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 320873000000000001
```

**Step 2: Take `layout`, `themes`, `settings` from the response `dashboardConfig` object**

Strip out `objId`, `displayName`, `description` — these are read-only fields in the GET response and are not valid CONFIG fields for Create.

**Step 3: POST to Create Dashboard with a new `displayName`**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/320873000000001001/dashboards
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={
  "displayName": "Sales Overview - Copy",
  "description": "Cloned from Sales Overview dashboard",
  "layout": { <layout from GET response> },
  "themes": { <themes from GET response> },
  "settings": { <settings from GET response> }
}
```

> **Note:** `viewName` values inside `layout` must match the display names of existing analysis views in the **target workspace**. If cloning across workspaces, update the `viewName` values accordingly before posting.

## Special Cases and Caveats

| Case | Behaviour | Recommendation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Partial settings in Update** | If you send `settings` with only some keys, all other settings revert to system defaults. Only explicitly-set values are stored. | Always send the full settings object (fetched via GET) with your changes merged in. |
| **Omitting a section in Update** | If `layout`, `themes`, or `settings` is absent from the CONFIG, that section is **not changed**. Safe to omit sections you are not modifying. | Only include the section(s) you intend to replace. |
| **`layoutType` preset in Create/Update** | When `layoutType` is `1`–`4` (grid preset), the server **auto-injects** a USERFILTERS card at position `"1"` and rearranges view cards into columns. Your input card order may be renumbered. | Omit `layoutType` (or set to `0`) for free-form layouts. Use GET after Create/Update to confirm the final stored layout. |
| **`viewName` in layout cards** | Identifies an analysis view by its **display name** (not ID). If the referenced view is renamed or deleted, the card will show as broken in the dashboard. | Always verify view names using the Reports API before sending layout. |
| **Reset theme to defaults** | Send `{"themes": {"default": "true"}}` in Update to clear all custom theme settings and restore the system default theme. | Use this to undo theme customizations in a single call without needing to know the original values. |
| **`objId` in GET response** | The `dashboardConfig.objId` field is the dashboard ID. Use it directly as `<dashboard-id>` in the Update URL. | `objId` = `dashboardId` (Create response) = `viewId` (listing API response). Same value, different field names. |
| **Tabbed dashboards** | Error `8102` is returned if you call Get Metadata or Update on a tabbed dashboard. These are not supported via the V2 API. | Use the UI or check the dashboard type before calling these APIs. |
| **`include` with comma-separated values** | Requesting `include=themes,layout` returns both sections without `objId`, `displayName`, or `description`. These top-level identity fields are only included when `include=all` (or omitted). | Always use `include=all` (default) when you need identity fields for clone workflows. |
