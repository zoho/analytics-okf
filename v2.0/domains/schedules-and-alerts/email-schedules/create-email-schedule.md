# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.create`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |
| `Content-Type` | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Required | The CONFIG JSON is sent as a form field named `CONFIG`. |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

CONFIG is **mandatory** for this API.

| Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `scheduleName` | String | **Yes** | — | Name of the schedule. Must be **unique within the workspace** (`8000` otherwise). Also one of the two inputs that decide whether a later update regenerates the ID — see [Schedule ID Lifecycle](overview.md#schedule-id-lifecycle). |
| `viewIds` | JSONArray of String/Long | **Yes** | — | IDs of the views to deliver, 1–1000 entries. All must belong to `<workspace-id>`, and the caller must have Export permission on each. Duplicates are removed. **Cannot be changed after creation** — there is no `viewIds` attribute on the update API. |
| `exportType` | String (enum) | **Yes** | — | File format of the attachment. See [`exportType` Values](#exporttype-values). Case-insensitive on input, normalised to upper case. **Cannot be changed after creation.** |
| `scheduleDetails` | JSONObject | **Yes** | — | When the schedule runs. See [`scheduleDetails` Fields](#scheduledetails-fields). |
| `emailIds` | JSONArray of String | No* | — | Recipient email addresses, 0–1000 entries. Lower-cased and de-duplicated. Addresses outside a trusted domain may be rejected (`8031`). |
| `groupIds` | JSONArray of String/Long | No* | — | IDs of [workspace groups](../../users-and-groups/workspace-groups/overview.md) whose members receive the email, 0–1000 entries. Must belong to `<workspace-id>`. |
| `cc` | JSONObject | No | — | Carbon-copy recipients. See [`cc` Fields](#cc-fields). |
| `isBCC` | Boolean | No | `true` | When `true` (the default), the addresses in `emailIds` are placed in **BCC** so recipients cannot see one another. Set `false` to address them in the **To** line. |
| `subject` | String | No | System default | Subject line of the email. Max 500 characters. |
| `message` | String | No | System default | Body text of the email. Max 5,000 characters. HTML is sanitised. |
| `applyShareCriteria` | Boolean | No | `false` | When `true`, each recipient receives an export filtered by the **share criteria already configured for that user** on the view — so different recipients see different rows from one schedule. Increases quota consumption to one unit per recipient (see [Quota Consumption](overview.md#quota-consumption)). |
| `applyDefaultUf` | Boolean | No | `false` | When `true`, the view's **default user filter** values are applied to the export instead of the unfiltered view. |
| `emailAsInline` | Boolean | No | `false` | When `true`, the exported content is rendered **inline in the email body** instead of being attached as a file. Meaningful for `HTML` exports. |
| `isNormalDbExp` | Boolean | No | `false` | Dashboard export layout switch. When `true`, the dashboard is exported in the standard document layout rather than the widget-by-widget layout. Applies to dashboard schedules only. |
| `selectedTabs` | JSONArray | No | All tabs | For a **tabbed dashboard**, restricts delivery to the listed tabs. 0–30 entries. Ignored for other view types. |
| `reportBurstConfig` | JSONObject | No | — | Turns the schedule into a **report burst** — one personalised email per row of a distribution-list table. See [`reportBurstConfig` Fields](#reportburstconfig-fields). |
| `validateSystemTags` | Boolean | No | `true` | If `true`, the request is rejected with a confirmation-required error (`8241`) when any view in `viewIds` carries a restricted **DATA_WARNING** system tag — directly, or inherited through lineage from a parent data source or table. Pass `false` to acknowledge and proceed. Only relevant when System Tags are enabled for the organization. |

\* At least one delivery target is required: the combination of `emailIds`, `groupIds`, and `cc` must resolve to at least one address, otherwise error [`8033`](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8033).

> The `timeZone` of a schedule is **not settable through this API**. Every schedule is created in the timezone of the workspace's Account Admin, and that timezone is preserved for the life of the schedule.

### `exportType` Values

| Value | Meaning | Restrictions |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `CSV` | Comma-separated values file. | Not permitted for dashboards. |
| `XLS` | Excel workbook. | **Only one view** may be scheduled (`8037` if `viewIds` has more than one). Not permitted for dashboards. |
| `PDF` | PDF document. | Permitted for all view types, including dashboards. |
| `HTML` | HTML document, attachable or inline (see `emailAsInline`). | Permitted for all view types, including dashboards. |
| `IMG` | Image file. | **Chart views only** — every view in `viewIds` must be a chart (`8036` otherwise). Not permitted for dashboards. |

> **Dashboard rules:** a schedule whose first view is a dashboard may contain **only that one view** ([`8034`](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8034) otherwise) and may use only `PDF` or `HTML` ([`8035`](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8035) otherwise).

### `scheduleDetails` Fields

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |

| `skipFrequency` | Integer | No | `0` | How many periods to skip between runs — `0` means every period, `1` means every other, and so on. The permitted maximum depends on `calendarFrequency`: **0–6** for `daily`, **0–3** for `weekly`, **0–11** for `monthly`, **0–4** for `yearly`. |
| `weekDays` | JSONArray of Integer | **Yes** for `weekly` | — | Days of the week to run on. `1` = Sunday … `7` = Saturday. |
| `weekNumber` | Integer | Conditional | — | Week of the month, **1–5**. Required for `monthly`/`yearly` when `monthDays`/`monthDay` is not supplied. |
| `weekDay` | Integer | Conditional | — | A single day of the week, `1` = Sunday … `7` = Saturday. Used together with `weekNumber`. |
| `monthDays` | JSONArray of Integer | Conditional | — | Days of the month for `monthly`. Values **1–31**, or **`99` to mean "last day of the month"**. Supply either `monthDays` **or** the `weekNumber` + `weekDay` pair. |
| `months` | JSONArray of Integer | **Yes** for `yearly` | — | Months to run in, `1` = January … `12` = December. |
| `monthDay` | Integer | Conditional | — | A single day of the month for `yearly`. Values **1–31**, or **`99` for the last day**. Supply either `monthDay` **or** the `weekNumber` + `weekDay` pair. |

| `emailIds` | JSONArray of String | No | Carbon-copy email addresses. Lower-cased and de-duplicated. |
| `groupIds` | JSONArray of String/Long | No | IDs of workspace groups to carbon-copy. Must belong to `<workspace-id>`. |

### `reportBurstConfig` Fields

A report burst reads a **distribution-list table** and sends one personalised email per row, filtering each report by values taken from that row.

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|--------------|
| `zaTableId` | Long | **Yes** | ID of the table holding the distribution list (`8040` if not found). |

| `reports[].sortOrder` | Integer | No | Position of this report within the email. |
| `reports[].filterColumns` | JSONArray | No | 0–10 entries mapping distribution-list columns to report columns. |
| `reports[].filterColumns[].criteriaColumnId` | Long | **Yes** | Column in the distribution-list table supplying the filter value. |
| `reports[].filterColumns[].targetColumnId` | Long | **Yes** | Column in the report that the value filters (`8045` if not found). |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

The attributes inside scheduleDetails apply based on the calendarFrequency value.
- weekDay and weekDays - applicable for weekly schedules.
- weekNumber, monthDay and monthDays - applicable for monthly schedules.
- months - applicable for yearly schedules, along with the relevant day attributes.

validateSystemTags is applicable only when System Tags are enabled for your organization. When it is set to true, a view listed in viewIds that carries an Outdated tag - applied directly, or inherited through lineage from a parent Data Source or Table - causes the request to be rejected, and no views are shared.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `status` | String | `"success"` on a successful call, `"failure"` on error. |
| `summary` | String | Localised operation summary. `"Create Email Schedule"` for this API. |
| `data` | JSONObject | Response payload wrapper. |
| `data.scheduleId` | String | ID of the newly created schedule, serialised as a **string**. Store it — but note it is **not permanently stable**: a later update that changes the name or the run period replaces it. See [Schedule ID Lifecycle](overview.md#schedule-id-lifecycle). |

> The response does not echo back the schedule's configuration. Confirm what was stored with [Get Email Schedules](get-email-schedules.md).

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Create Email Schedule](../../../sdk-examples/schedules-and-alerts/email-schedules/create-email-schedule.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **`viewIds` and `exportType` are permanent** | Neither appears in the update CONFIG. To deliver different views or a different file format, delete the schedule and create a new one. |
| **Names must be unique per workspace** | A duplicate `scheduleName` fails with `8000`; the call is never turned into an update. |
| **Export permission is checked per view** | The caller must hold Export permission on **every** view in `viewIds`, in addition to the workspace-level Create Email Schedule permission. |
| **At least one resolved recipient is required** | `emailIds`, `groupIds`, and `cc` may each be omitted, but between them they must resolve to at least one address — otherwise `8033`. An empty group counts for nothing. |
| **Recipients are BCC by default** | `isBCC` defaults to **`true`**, so recipients cannot see one another unless you explicitly send `isBCC: false`. |
| **`applyShareCriteria` multiplies quota** | It changes consumption from one unit per 25 addresses to **one unit per recipient**, because each recipient gets an individually filtered export. Budget accordingly on large lists. |
| **Format restrictions are view-type dependent** | `XLS` is single-view only; `IMG` is chart-only; dashboards are single-view and `PDF`/`HTML` only. See [`exportType` Values](#exporttype-values). |
| **Timezone is inherited, not chosen** | The schedule runs in the workspace Account Admin's timezone. `scheduleDetails.hour` / `minute` are interpreted in that timezone, and `schedulePeriod` in the list response is rendered with it. |
| **Untrusted recipient domains are rejected** | If the organization restricts sharing to trusted domains, addresses outside them fail with `8031`. |
| **No `criteria` attribute** | Per-request row filtering is not supported; use `applyShareCriteria` (per-recipient share filters) or `reportBurstConfig` (per-row bursting). |
| **Not callable from a portal domain** | See [White Label / Client Portal Behaviour](overview.md#white-label--client-portal-behaviour). |
| **Dependency chain** | [Get View List](../../views-management/view-operations/get-views.md) → `viewIds`; [Get Group List](../../users-and-groups/workspace-groups/get-groups.md) → `groupIds` → Create Email Schedule → `scheduleId`. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — Workspace not found. | Verify `<workspace-id>` and the `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header. |
| [7104](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7104) | 404 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — A view in `viewIds` does not exist. | Verify the IDs via [Get View List](../../views-management/view-operations/get-views.md). |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | `SECURITY_NOT_PERMITTED` — Request came through a Client Portal / White Label domain, the user lacks Create Email Schedule permission, or lacks Export permission on a view in `viewIds`. | Call from the standard API host with the required permissions. |
| [7319](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7319) | 400 | `OBJID_NOT_BELONGS_TO_DB` — A view in `viewIds` belongs to a different workspace. | Include only views from `<workspace-id>`. |
| [7832](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7832) | 400 | `INVALID_EXPORT_TYPE` — `exportType` is not one of the supported formats. | Use `CSV`, `XLS`, `PDF`, `HTML`, or `IMG`. |
| [8000](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8000) | 400 | `DUPLICATE_SCHEDULE` — A schedule with this `scheduleName` already exists in the workspace. | Choose a different name. |
| [8001](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8001) | 400 | `MAILCOUNT_PER_SCHED_EXCEED` — Too many recipients for a single schedule. | Reduce the recipient list, or split it across schedules. |
| [8009](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8009) | 400 | `MAIL_MULTIVIEW_MAXCOUNT_EXCEEEDED` — Too many views in one schedule. | Reduce `viewIds`, or split across schedules. |
| [8030](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8030) | 400 | `EMAILEXPORT_DISABLED_IN_ORG` — Email export is disabled for this organization. | Ask the Organization Admin to enable export in Security Controls. |
| [8031](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8031) | 400 | `UNTRUSTED_EMAILIDS` — A recipient address is outside the organization's trusted domains. | Use trusted-domain addresses, or ask the Organization Admin to add the domain. |
| [8032](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8032) | 400 | `EMAILINGVIEW_DISABLED` — Emailing this view is disabled. | Check the view's and workspace's export settings. |
