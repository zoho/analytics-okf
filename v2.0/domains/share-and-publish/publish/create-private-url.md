# Summary

**POST `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/views/{view-id}/publish/privatelink`** - Create Private URL (Publish / Share & Publish).

Creates a **Private URL** for a view — generating the secret private key if one does not exist — and, in the same call, sets the link's permission set, row-level filter criteria, column restrictions, password, and expiry date. The freshly built private URL is returned in the response.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Creates a private URL for the specified view and returns it. The private URL can be protected with a password and given a validity period, and the permissions granted through it are controlled by the config.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.embed.update`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |
| `Content-Type` | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Required | The CONFIG JSON is sent as a form field named `CONFIG`. |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{view-id}` | string | ID of the view. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#view-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `criteria` | String | No | `""` (no filter) | Row-level filter criteria applied to **every private-link visitor**, e.g. `"Sales_1"."Region"='West'`. Only applied when `permissions` is being (re)written — that is, on first creation or when `permissions` is present in the request. |
| `permissions` | JSONObject | No | `read: true`, everything else `false` | Read-only permission set granted to private-link visitors. `read` must not be `false` (`8074`). See [`permissions` Fields](make-views-public.md#permissions-fields) — note that `drillThrough` is always forced to `false` for a private link. |
| `includeAllColsForVUD` | Boolean | No | `false` | Applies only when `permissions.vud` is `true`. If `true`, "View Underlying Data" shows **all** columns of the underlying table instead of only the columns involved in the report. |
| `vudColumns` | JSONArray | No | — | Applies only when `permissions.vud` is `true`. Restricts "View Underlying Data" to exactly the listed columns. 1–100 entries. See [`vudColumns` / `drillColumns` Fields](make-views-public.md#vudcolumns--drillcolumns-fields). |
| `drillColumns` | JSONArray | No | — | Applies only when `permissions.drillDown` is `true`. Restricts drill-down to exactly the listed columns. When omitted, drill-down is limited to the columns involved in the report. 1–100 entries. Same shape as `vudColumns`. |
| `password` | String | No | — (no password) | Password the visitor must enter before the view is rendered. **Minimum 6 characters**, maximum 256. Setting or changing the password invalidates all existing private-link sessions. Mutually exclusive with `removePassword`. |
| `removePassword` | Boolean | No | `false` | If `true` (and `password` is not supplied), removes the existing password so the link opens without a prompt. Ignored when `password` is present. |
| `expiryDate` | String | No | — (never expires) | Date on which the link stops working, in **`dd/MM/yyyy`** format interpreted in **GMT**. The link remains usable until the end of that day. Mutually exclusive with `removeExpiryDate`. |
| `removeExpiryDate` | Boolean | No | `false` | If `true` (and `expiryDate` is not supplied), removes the existing expiry date so the link never expires. Ignored when `expiryDate` is present. |
| `regenerateKey` | Boolean | No | `false` | If `true`, discards the existing private key and generates a new one — instantly invalidating every previously distributed private URL for this view. Has no effect on first creation (a key is generated regardless). |
| `domainName` | String | No | — | Client Portal / White Label domain to build the returned URL on. Only usable by a Client Portal admin of the workspace. Max 200 characters. |
| `withCustomDomain` | Boolean | No | `false` | **Legacy flag.** If `true`, builds the returned URL on the workspace's configured portal domain without naming it. Requires the caller to be an Organization Admin or Super Admin **and** a Client Portal admin of the workspace. Prefer `domainName`. |
| `validateSystemTags` | Boolean | No | `true` | If `true`, the request is blocked with a confirmation-required error (`8241`) when the view carries a restricted **DATA_WARNING** system tag. Pass `false` to acknowledge the warning and create the link anyway. |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- `CONFIG` may be omitted entirely. When it is, a private URL is created with the default settings.
- `password` and `removePassword` are mutually exclusive, as are `expiryDate` and `removeExpiryDate`.
- `vudColumns` is applicable only when the `vud` permission is set to true.
- `drillColumns` is applicable only when the `drillDown` permission is set to true.
- Setting `regenerateKey` to true disables the private link that was issued previously.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `status` | String | `"success"` on a successful call, `"failure"` on error. |
| `summary` | String | Localised operation summary. `"Create private URL"` for this API. |
| `data` | JSONObject | Response payload wrapper. |
| `data.privateUrl` | String | The private URL of the view, in the form `https://<analytics-domain>/open-view/<view-id>/<private-key>`. When `regenerateKey: true` was sent, this contains the **new** key and every previously distributed URL is dead. **Treat this value as a secret.** The response never echoes back the `password` or `expiryDate` that were set — read those back via [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md). |

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Idempotent creation, incremental update** | On a view with no private link, this API generates a key and applies the full permission set. On a view that already has a link, the key is reused (unless `regenerateKey: true`) and `permissions` / `criteria` / column restrictions are only rewritten when `permissions` is present in the request. Password and expiry are applied whenever their fields are present. |
| **`criteria` needs `permissions`** | Because the row filter is persisted as part of the private-link share record, sending `criteria` **without** `permissions` on an already-existing link leaves the criteria unchanged. Send `permissions` (at minimum `{"read": true}`) alongside `criteria` when updating an existing link. |
| **`drillThrough` is always off** | Unlike a public link, a private link can never be granted `drillThrough` — the value is forced to `false` regardless of what is sent. |
| **`password` wins over `removePassword`; `expiryDate` wins over `removeExpiryDate`** | If both are sent, the setter is applied and the remover is ignored — no error is raised. |
| **Password minimum length is enforced by the template** | A `password` shorter than 6 characters is rejected with `8080` `INVALID_JSON_CONFIGURATION`, not with a password-specific error. |
| **Setting a password kills live sessions** | Changing the password clears all existing private-link sessions, so visitors currently viewing the page must re-authenticate. |
| **`expiryDate` is GMT and end-of-day inclusive** | `"20/11/2030"` is stored as the last usable moment of 20 Nov 2030 GMT, not as midnight at its start. |
| **`regenerateKey` is destructive and immediate** | Every URL handed out earlier stops working the moment the new key is persisted. There is no grace period and no way to recover the old key. |
| **Plan limits apply to private links** | Creating a *new* private link consumes one of the organization's allotted private links (`6121` / `6122` when exhausted). Regenerating an existing key does not consume a new allotment but is itself plan-gated (`6055` / `6057`). |
| **A separate PUT endpoint also exists** | `PUT /publish/privatelink` ("Update Private Link Configurations") updates an existing private link and fails with `8115` if none exists. It is not covered by this document; this POST API covers both creation and update. |
| **Verifying the result** | The resulting private share is visible via [Get Shared Details](../sharing/get-shared-details-for-views.md) as a `shareInfo` entry with `sharedTo: "Private Link"`, `sharedToZuId: "-30"`, and `publicPermLevel: 0`; the password/expiry state is visible via [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md) (`privateLinkConfig`). |
| **Dependency chain** | [Get View List](../../views-management/view-operations/get-views.md) → `<view-id>` → Create Private URL → [Get Private URL](get-private-url.md) / [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md). |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|

| [8060](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8060) | 400 | `DOMAIN_NOT_EXIST` — The `domainName` supplied does not exist. | Use a domain returned by the [Domain and White Label APIs](../../workspace-management/domain-and-white-label/overview.md). |
| [8061](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8061) | 400 | `DOMAIN_DOES_NOT_BELONGS_TO_USER` — The caller is not an admin of the supplied `domainName`. | Call as an admin of that portal domain, or omit `domainName`. |
| [8074](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8074) | 400 | `READ_PERM_SHOULD_BE_TRUE_FOR_SHARING` — `permissions.read` was sent as `false`. | Omit `read` or set it to `true`. |
| [8080](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8080) | 400 | `INVALID_JSON_CONFIGURATION` — CONFIG is not valid JSON, contains an unsupported key, or violates a constraint (e.g. `password` shorter than 6 characters, malformed `expiryDate`). | Send only the documented keys with the documented types and formats. |
