# Summary

**POST `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/views/{view-id}/publish/public`** - Make View Public (Publish / Share & Publish).

Publishes a view as a **Public URL** and, in the same call, defines the read-only permission set, the row-level filter criteria, and the column restrictions that apply to public visitors. Calling it again on an already-public view **updates** the existing public share in place.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Makes the specified view publicly accessible and returns the public URL. The audience, the permissions granted on the view, and the rows and columns visible through it are all controlled by the config.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.embed.create`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |
| `Content-Type` | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Required | The CONFIG JSON is sent as a form field named `CONFIG`. |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{view-id}` | string | ID of the view. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#view-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `criteria` | String | No | — (no filter) | Row-level filter criteria applied to **every public visitor**, e.g. `"Sales_1"."Region"='West'`. Uses the same syntax as the sharing/report filter criteria. Validated against the view's involved columns — an unparseable criteria or an unknown column is rejected (`8054` / `8154`). |
| `inheritParentFilterCriteria` | Boolean | No | `false` | If `true`, the public visitor additionally inherits any filter criteria already applied on the parent view, on top of `criteria`. |
| `publicPermLevel` | String (enum `1` \| `2` \| `3`) | No | `1` | Audience of the public URL. See [`publicPermLevel` Values](#publicpermlevel-values). |
| `permissions` | JSONObject | No | `read: true`, everything else `false` | Read-only permission set granted to public visitors. `read` must not be `false` (`8074`). See [`permissions` Fields](#permissions-fields). |
| `includeAllColsForVUD` | Boolean | No | `false` | Applies only when `permissions.vud` is `true`. If `true`, "View Underlying Data" shows **all** columns of the underlying table instead of only the columns involved in the report. |
| `vudColumns` | JSONArray | No | — | Applies only when `permissions.vud` is `true`. Restricts "View Underlying Data" to exactly the listed columns. 1–100 entries. See [`vudColumns` / `drillColumns` Fields](#vudcolumns--drillcolumns-fields). |
| `drillColumns` | JSONArray | No | — | Applies only when `permissions.drillDown` is `true`. Restricts drill-down to exactly the listed columns. When omitted, drill-down is limited to the columns involved in the report. 1–100 entries. Same shape as `vudColumns`. |
| `domainName` | String | No | — | Client Portal / White Label domain to publish under. Only usable by a Client Portal admin of the workspace; the returned `publicUrl` is then built on that portal domain instead of the Zoho Analytics domain. Max 200 characters. |
| `validateSystemTags` | Boolean | No | `true` | If `true`, the request is blocked with a confirmation-required error (`8241`) when the view carries a restricted **DATA_WARNING** system tag. Pass `false` to acknowledge the warning and publish anyway. |

> `isListed` (whether a public workspace appears in Zoho Analytics' public listing) is **not** accepted here — set it through [Update Publish Configurations](update-publish-configurations.md).

### `publicPermLevel` Values

| Value | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `1` | Public | Anyone holding the URL, including anonymous visitors who are not signed in to Zoho. This is the default. |
| `2` | Organization Public | Only users signed in to the **same Zoho Analytics organization** as the workspace. Not available on the Free plan (`7531`). |
| `3` | Business Organization Public | Only users belonging to the **same business organization** (the parent Zoho org) as the workspace's Account Admin. Not available on the Free plan (`7531`), and the caller must belong to that same business organization (`7500`). |

> Use [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md) first to learn which levels are permitted for this workspace: `publicViewConfig.isOrgPublicAllowed` gates level `2` and `publicViewConfig.isBussOrgPublicAllowed` gates level `3`.
>
> In a Client Portal / White Label (custom-domain) request context, `publicPermLevel` is **forced to `1`** regardless of what is sent — the organization-scoped levels are not applicable to portal domains.

### `permissions` Fields

Only these seven fields are accepted for a public or private link. Every other permission in the general [sharing `permissions` object](../sharing/share-views.md#permissions-fields) (`addRow`, `updateRow`, `deleteRow`, `deleteAllRows`, the four `import*` modes, `share`, `discussion`, `createPreset`) is forced to `false` server-side and cannot be enabled through this API.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| `read` | Boolean | `true` | View/read access. Always granted. Explicitly sending `read: false` is rejected with `8074` `READ_PERM_SHOULD_BE_TRUE_FOR_SHARING`. |
| `export` | Boolean | `false` | Allows the visitor to export the view's data (CSV / Excel / PDF / image). |
| `vud` | Boolean | `false` | Allows "View Underlying Data" — drilling from an aggregated report into the raw rows behind it. Pair with `includeAllColsForVUD` / `vudColumns` to control which columns are exposed. |
| `drillDown` | Boolean | `false` | Allows drilling down into the view by column values. Pair with `drillColumns` to control which columns can be drilled. |
| `insight` | Boolean | `false` | Allows the visitor to view Zia Insights generated for the view. |
| `drillThrough` | Boolean | `false` | Allows drill-through actions from this view into linked views. **Public links only** — for a private link this field is always forced to `false`. |
| `accessAdminPresets` | Boolean | `false` | Allows the visitor to view/apply presets defined by the view's admin/owner. |

> For custom-role users the requested permission set is additionally **sanitised against the view type** — for example row-level or VUD permissions that make no sense for a dashboard are dropped silently rather than raising an error.

### `vudColumns` / `drillColumns` Fields

Each is a JSONArray of objects, one per underlying table referenced by the view:

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|--------------|
| `tableName` | String | **Yes** | Name of the underlying table whose columns are being restricted. Must be a table actually involved in the view (`7138` otherwise). Max 50 characters. |
| `columnNames` | JSONArray of String | **Yes** | Column names from `tableName` to expose. 1–300 entries. Each name must exist in that table (`8154` otherwise). |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- `CONFIG` may be omitted entirely. When it is, the view is published with the default settings.
- `vudColumns` is applicable only when the `vud` permission is set to true.
- `drillColumns` is applicable only when the `drillDown` permission is set to true.
- `inheritParentFilterCriteria` is applicable only for reports, not for tables.
- `validateSystemTags` is applicable only when System Tags are enabled for your organization.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `status` | String | `"success"` on a successful call, `"failure"` on error. |
| `summary` | String | Localised operation summary. `"Make view public"` for this API. |
| `data` | JSONObject | Response payload wrapper. |
| `data.publicUrl` | String | The public URL of the view, in the form `https://<analytics-domain>/open-view/<view-id>`. The host is the Zoho Analytics application domain for a standard workspace, or the workspace's Client Portal / White Label domain when the call is made in a portal context or with `domainName`. **Note:** this value does not encode `publicPermLevel` — the same URL is returned for all three audience levels; the audience restriction is enforced when the URL is opened. |

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Make View Public](../../../sdk-examples/share-and-publish/publish/make-views-public.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Create *and* update** | Although the operation type is `create`, calling this API on an already-public view **overwrites** the existing public share's permissions, criteria, and column restrictions rather than failing. There is no separate "update public link" API. |
| **Always read-only** | The permission array is sanitised to a read-only set before being persisted. Requesting write permissions has no effect — they are silently dropped, not rejected. |
| **`read` cannot be turned off** | Sending `permissions.read: false` fails with `8074`. Omitting `permissions` entirely grants read-only access. |
| **Column restrictions require the matching permission** | `vudColumns` is ignored unless `permissions.vud` is `true`; `drillColumns` is ignored unless `permissions.drillDown` is `true`. No error is raised for the ignored field. |
| **`publicPermLevel` is forced to `1` on custom domains** | In a Client Portal / White Label request context, the organization-scoped levels (`2`, `3`) are not applicable and the level is overridden to `1`. |
| **`criteria` is validated, `URLCriteria` is not the same thing** | The `criteria` here is a *share-level row filter* stored against the `Public Visitor` pseudo-user. It is unrelated to `URLCriteria` in [Update Publish Configurations](update-publish-configurations.md), which is a *URL parameter* applied when the published page is rendered. |
| **`domainName` ≠ `ZANALYTICS-DEST-ORGID`** | `domainName` scopes the operation to a Client Portal / White Label domain. It is a completely different mechanism from the `ZANALYTICS-DEST-ORGID` header used by cross-org copy operations (see [Copy Views](../../views-management/view-operations/copy-views.md)) — never substitute one for the other. |
| **Verifying the result** | The resulting public share is visible via [Get Shared Details](../sharing/get-shared-details-for-views.md) as a `shareInfo` entry with `sharedTo: "Public Visitor"`, `sharedToZuId: "-20"`, and `publicPermLevel` set to the audience level; and via [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md) as `publicViewConfig.publicPermLevel`. |
| **Dependency chain** | [Get View List](../../views-management/view-operations/get-views.md) → `<view-id>` → (optional) [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md) to check allowed audience levels → Make View Public. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [6054](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-6054) | 400 | `PUBLISHCNT_VIOLATION` — The current plan does not allow this publish operation. | Upgrade the plan, or publish as a private link instead. |
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — Workspace not found. | Verify `<workspace-id>` and that the `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header matches it. |
| [7104](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7104) | 404 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — View not found. | Verify `<view-id>` exists. |
| [7138](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7138) | 400 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — A `tableName` in `vudColumns` / `drillColumns` is not a table involved in this view. | Use only tables that the view actually reads from. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | `SECURITY_NOT_PERMITTED` — The user cannot make this view public (no Make Public permission, or the workspace/view is restricted). | Ensure the user is an Account Admin, Organization Admin, Workspace Admin, or has Make Public permission on the view. |
| [7319](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7319) | 400 | `OBJID_NOT_BELONGS_TO_DB` — The view does not belong to the specified workspace. | Ensure `<workspace-id>` and `<view-id>` are consistent. |
| [7500](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7500) | 400 | `UNAUTHORIZED_ORG_CANNOT_MAKEPUBLIC` — `publicPermLevel: "3"` requested but the caller does not belong to the workspace admin's business organization. | Use `publicPermLevel` `1` or `2`, or call as a user of the same business organization. |
| [7531](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7531) | 400 | `PUBLIC_TO_ORG_NOT_SUPPORTED_IN_FREE` — `publicPermLevel` `2` or `3` is not supported on the Free plan. | Upgrade the plan, or use `publicPermLevel: "1"`. |
| [7565](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7565) | 400 | `UNVERIFIED_EMAIL` — The calling user's primary email address is not verified. | Verify the account's primary email address and retry. |
| [8054](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8054) | 400 | `INVALID_FILTER_CRITERIA` — `criteria` could not be parsed. | Correct the criteria syntax (e.g. `"Table"."Column"='Value'`). |
| [8060](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8060) | 400 | `DOMAIN_NOT_EXIST` — The `domainName` supplied does not exist. | Use a domain returned by the [Domain and White Label APIs](../../workspace-management/domain-and-white-label/overview.md). |
| [8061](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8061) | 400 | `DOMAIN_DOES_NOT_BELONGS_TO_USER` — The caller is not an admin of the supplied `domainName`. | Call as an admin of that portal domain, or omit `domainName`. |
| [8074](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8074) | 400 | `READ_PERM_SHOULD_BE_TRUE_FOR_SHARING` — `permissions.read` was sent as `false`. | Omit `read` or set it to `true`. |
| [8080](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8080) | 400 | `INVALID_JSON_CONFIGURATION` — CONFIG is not valid JSON, contains an unsupported key, or violates a type/length/allowed-value constraint (e.g. `publicPermLevel` outside `1`/`2`/`3`). | Send only the documented keys with the documented types. |
| [8088](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8088) | 400 | `SECURITY_CONTROLS_FEATURE_DISABLED` — Public sharing has been disabled for this organization/workspace by security controls. | Ask the Organization Admin to re-enable public sharing in Security Controls. |
| [8154](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8154) | 400 | `COLUMN_NOT_PRESENT_IN_TABLE` — A column in `vudColumns` / `drillColumns` (or in `criteria`) does not exist in the given table. | Verify column names via [Get Columns](../../data-modeling-and-schema/columns/overview.md). |
| [8241](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8241) | 409 | `SYSTEM_TAG_DATA_WARNING_V2_VALIDATION_CONFIRMATION` — The view carries a restricted DATA_WARNING system tag. | Review the warning, then resend with `"validateSystemTags": false` to confirm. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | `INVALID_OAUTHTOKEN` — Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token with scope `ZohoAnalytics.embed.create`. |
| [12052](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-12052) | 400 | `WORKSPACE_NOT_ENABLED_FOR_DOMAIN_ACCESS` — The workspace is not enabled for access through the requested portal domain. | Enable the workspace for that Client Portal domain first. |
