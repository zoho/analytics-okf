# Summary

**DELETE `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/views/{view-id}/publish/public`** - Remove Public Permission (Publish / Share & Publish).

Un-publishes the view's **Public URL**, revoking access for all public visitors. The private link (if any) and the publish configuration are left untouched.

> This API has no CONFIG parameter. All inputs are provided via URL path parameters only.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Removes the public access granted on the specified view. Once removed, the public URL generated for the view no longer resolves.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.embed.delete`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{view-id}` | string | ID of the view. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#view-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `204 No Content`. The response has no body; treat the status code alone as success. Failures still return the JSON error envelope described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

Not applicable — this API never returns a JSON body on success (HTTP 204 No Content). Only failure responses contain a JSON error payload (`status`, `summary`, `data.errorCode`, `data.errorMessage`).

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Standard workspace**

```http
DELETE /restapi/v2/workspaces/137687000271334001/views/137687000006991601/publish/public HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

**Case 2 — White Label / Client Portal workspace**

```http
DELETE /restapi/v2/workspaces/137687000271334009/views/137687000006991777/publish/public HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000654321
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 204 No Content**

This API returns **no response body** on success — only an HTTP `204 No Content` status. There is no JSON payload to parse on success; check only the HTTP status code.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

**HTTP 403 Forbidden — Failure responses still carry a JSON body**

```json
{
    "status": "failure",
    "summary": "SECURITY_NOT_PERMITTED",
    "data": {
        "errorCode": 7301,
        "errorMessage": "You (WL_DBAdmin) do not have the permission to do this operation. "
    }
}
```

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Remove Public Permission](../../../sdk-examples/share-and-publish/publish/remove-public-permission.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Success response has no body** | Remove Public Permission returns a bare HTTP `204 No Content` — no `status`/`summary` JSON to parse. |
| **Not idempotent when the view has no shares at all** | If the view is not shared to anyone (no users, no groups, no public/private link), the call fails with `8032` `VIEW_NOT_SHARED` rather than succeeding silently. If the view has other shares but is not public, the public entry is simply not found and the call completes without error. |
| **Only the public channel is removed** | An active private link on the same view survives this call — remove it with [Remove Private Access](remove-private-access.md). |
| **Publish configuration survives** | The presentation settings read by [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md) are not reset; re-publishing the view later reuses them. |
| **Audience level is irrelevant** | The same call removes a level-`1`, level-`2`, or level-`3` public share; there is no per-level removal. |
| **Dependency chain** | [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md) (confirm `publicViewConfig.publicPermLevel > 0`) → Remove Public Permission. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — Workspace not found. | Verify `<workspace-id>` and the `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header. |
| [7104](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7104) | 404 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — View not found. | Verify `<view-id>` exists. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | `SECURITY_NOT_PERMITTED` — The user cannot un-publish this view. | Ensure the user is an Account Admin, Organization Admin, Workspace Admin, or has Make Public / Share permission on the view. |
| [7319](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7319) | 400 | `OBJID_NOT_BELONGS_TO_DB` — The view does not belong to the specified workspace. | Ensure `<workspace-id>` and `<view-id>` are consistent. |
| [7565](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7565) | 400 | `UNVERIFIED_EMAIL` — The calling user's primary email address is not verified. | Verify the account's primary email address and retry. |
| [8032](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8032) | 400 | `VIEW_NOT_SHARED` — The view is not shared to anyone, so there is no public permission to remove. | Confirm the view is public via [Get Publish Configurations](get-publish-configurations.md) before calling. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | `INVALID_OAUTHTOKEN` — Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token with scope `ZohoAnalytics.embed.delete`. |
