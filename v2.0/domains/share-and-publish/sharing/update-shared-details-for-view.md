# Summary

**PUT `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/views/{view-id}/share`** - Update Shared Details (Sharing / Share & Publish).

Updates the permission set, column/row restrictions, or filter criteria of an **existing** share on a single view, for the users/groups specified.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Updates the existing sharing configuration of the specified view for the given users or groups. The permissions, filter criteria, and column restrictions sent in the config replace the ones currently in effect for that view.

| OpenAPI | [`share-publish-grouped-api.json`](../../../references/openapi/share-publish-grouped-api.json) - pointer `#/paths/~1restapi~1v2~1workspaces~1{workspace-id}~1views~1{view-id}~1share/put`; CONFIG schema `UpdateSharedDetailsConfig` |

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.share.update`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |
| `Content-Type` | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Required | The CONFIG JSON is sent as a form field named `CONFIG`. |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{view-id}` | string | ID of the view. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#view-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

Same structure as [Share Views](share-views.md) **except there is no `viewIds` key** — the view is identified by `<view-id>` in the URL, and there are no `inviteMail`/`inviteMailCCMe`/`mailSubject`/`mailMessage` fields (no invite email is sent on an update).

| Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `emailIds` | JSONArray of String | No* | — | Email addresses whose share on `<view-id>` should be updated. |
| `groupIds` | JSONArray of String/Long | No* | — | Group IDs whose share on `<view-id>` should be updated. |
| `permissions` | JSONObject | No | unchanged if omitted | New permission set to apply. See [`permissions` Fields](share-views.md#permissions-fields). `read` must remain `true`. |
| `columns` | JSONArray | No | unchanged if omitted | See [`columns` Fields](share-views.md#columns--vudcolumns--drillcolumns-fields). |
| `includeAllColsForVUD` | Boolean | No | unchanged if omitted | If `true`, the shared user can view all columns in "View Underlying Data" mode instead of only the columns in `vudColumns`. Same semantics as in [Share Views](share-views.md). |
| `vudColumns` | JSONArray | No | unchanged if omitted | Restricts which columns are visible in "View Underlying Data" mode. Same shape as `columns` — see [Share Views](share-views.md). |
| `drillColumns` | JSONArray | No | unchanged if omitted | Restricts which columns are visible when the shared user drills down. Same shape as `columns` — see [Share Views](share-views.md). |
| `criteria` | String | No | unchanged if omitted | New row-level filter criteria. Pass an empty string to clear an existing criteria. |
| `inheritParentFilterCriteria` | Boolean | No | unchanged if omitted | If `true`, the shared user also inherits any filter criteria already applied on the view for the sharer, in addition to `criteria`. Same semantics as in [Share Views](share-views.md). |
| `domainName` | String | No | — | Client Portal/White Label domain to scope this update to. |
| `validateSystemTags` | Boolean | No | `true` | If `true`, the update is blocked with a confirmation-required error (`8241`) when `<view-id>` carries a restricted **DATA_WARNING** system tag. Pass `false` to acknowledge the warning and update anyway. Same semantics as in [Share Views](share-views.md). |

\* At least one of `emailIds` or `groupIds` is required, identifying which existing share(s) on `<view-id>` to update.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- At least one of `emailIds` or `groupIds` must be specified, to identify the users or the groups whose sharing configuration has to be updated.
- `vudColumns` is applicable only when the `vud` permission is set to true.
- `drillColumns` is applicable only when the `drillDown` permission is set to true.
- `inheritParentFilterCriteria` is applicable only for reports, not for tables.
- `validateSystemTags` is applicable only when System Tags are enabled for your organization.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `204 No Content`. The response has no body; treat the status code alone as success. Failures still return the JSON error envelope described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

Not applicable — this API never returns a JSON body on success (HTTP 204 No Content). Only failure responses contain a JSON error payload.

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Grant export access to an already-shared user**

```http
PUT /restapi/v2/workspaces/137687000271334001/views/137687000006991601/share HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={
    "emailIds": ["jane.doe@example.com"],
    "permissions": {
        "read": true,
        "export": true
    }
}
```

**Case 2 — Client Portal: update a group's share to remove write access**

```http
PUT /restapi/v2/workspaces/137687000271334009/views/137687000006991777/share HTTP/1.1
Host: portal.customdomain.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000654321
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={
    "groupIds": ["137687000006991790"],
    "permissions": {
        "read": true,
        "export": true,
        "addRow": false,
        "updateRow": false
    },
    "domainName": "portal.customdomain.com"
}
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 204 No Content**

This API returns **no response body** on success — only an HTTP `204 No Content` status. There is no JSON payload to parse on success; check only the HTTP status code.

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Update Shared Details](../../../sdk-examples/share-and-publish/sharing/update-shared-details-for-view.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Success response has no body** | Update Shared Details returns a bare HTTP `204 No Content` on success. |
| **View must already be shared** | This API modifies an existing share; it does not create a new one — if the user/group is not currently shared on `<view-id>`, error 8032 `VIEW_NOT_SHARED` (or 8150 for groups) is returned. Use Share Views to create the share first. |
| **Partial update semantics** | Any field omitted from CONFIG leaves that aspect of the share unchanged; only supplied fields are applied. |
| **Dependency** | [Get Shared Details](get-shared-details-for-views.md) → identify the current share state → Update Shared Details. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | `SECURITY_NOT_PERMITTED` — User does not have Share permission on `<view-id>`. | Ensure the user is an Account Admin, Organization Admin, or Workspace Admin, or has Share permission on the view. |
| [7542](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7542) | 400 | `FILTER_CRITERIA_NOT_PERMITTED_FOR_SHARED_USER` — `criteria` update is not permitted for this share type. | Remove or adjust the `criteria` field. |
| [7545](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7545) | 400 | `SHARE_AND_WRITE_PERMISSIONS_NOT_ALLOWED_FOR_RO_USERS` — A Read-Only user was granted `share` together with a write permission. | Do not combine `share: true` with write permissions for Read-Only users. |
| [8032](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8032) | 400 | `VIEW_NOT_SHARED` — The view is not currently shared with the specified user. | Share the view first via Share Views. |
| [8074](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8074) | 400 | `READ_PERM_SHOULD_BE_TRUE_FOR_SHARING` — `permissions.read` was explicitly set to `false`. | Keep `permissions.read` as `true`. |
| [8080](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8080) | 400 | `INVALID_JSON_CONFIGURATION` — CONFIG is malformed or missing a required field. | Validate the CONFIG JSON against the parameter table above. |
| [8150](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8150) | 400 | `VIEW_NOT_SHARED_TO_GROUP` — The view is not currently shared with the specified group. | Share the view to this group first via Share Views. |
| [8241](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8241) | 409 | `SYSTEM_TAG_DATA_WARNING_V2_VALIDATION_CONFIRMATION` (HTTP 409) — `<view-id>` carries a restricted DATA_WARNING system tag. | Review the warning, then resend with `"validateSystemTags": false` to confirm. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | The OAuth access token is missing, expired, revoked, or does not carry the scope required by this operation. | Regenerate the access token with the required scope (see the endpoint document) and retry. |
