# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.share.create`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |
| `Content-Type` | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Required | The CONFIG JSON is sent as a form field named `CONFIG`. |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |

## CONFIG Parameter

CONFIG is **mandatory**. It must be sent as a form-encoded body parameter named `CONFIG`.

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `groupName` | String | **Yes** | — | Display name for the new group. Must be unique within the workspace. Empty or blank values are rejected. |
| `emailIds` | Array of Strings | **Yes** | — | Email addresses of the initial group members. Min 1, max 1000 entries. Members must already be workspace users (or members of the specified portal domain). |
| `groupDesc` | String | No | `""` | A short description of the group's purpose. Max 200 characters. When omitted, defaults to an empty string. |
| `domainName` | String | No | `null` | Client portal domain for portal-scoped groups. When provided, the group is associated with the specified portal domain. All `emailIds` must belong to users within that portal domain. When omitted, the group is created in the standard Zoho Analytics domain context. |
| `inviteMail` | Boolean | No | `false` | When `false` (default): no email is sent to the initial members. When `true`: an invitation email is sent to all newly added group members informing them of their group access. |
| `mailSubject` | String | No | `""` | Custom subject line for the invitation email. Only relevant when `inviteMail` is `true`. Max 500 characters. |
| `mailMessage` | String | No | `""` | Custom message body for the invitation email. Supports basic HTML. Only relevant when `inviteMail` is `true`. Max 5000 characters. |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- The Zoho account of the calling user must be confirmed (email verified) to invoke this API.
- The calling user must be a Workspace Admin of the workspace. Account Admins and Organization Admins also have access.
- The group name must be unique within the workspace. A duplicate name fails with error code **7282**. The same name can exist in different workspaces.
- A minimum of 1 and a maximum of 1000 email addresses can be sent. The users must already be members of the workspace, or of the specified client portal domain.
- No duplicate check is performed on **emailIds** at creation - the same address listed more than once results in a single membership.
- The **domainName** association is set at creation only and cannot be changed afterwards. To move a group to a different portal domain, delete it and create it again.
- When **domainName** is provided, every email address must belong to a user within that portal domain. Standard Zoho Analytics domain users cannot be added to a portal-domain group. When it is omitted, an org-wide group is created and any workspace user can be a member.
- When **inviteMail** is set to true without **mailSubject** or **mailMessage**, the invitation is sent with a system generated subject and message.
- A failure in delivering the invitation email does not roll back the operation. The group and its members are created even when the email cannot be delivered.
- Only the new **groupId** is returned. Use the Get Group Details API to retrieve the full group record.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `data.groupId` | String | Unique identifier of the newly created group. Use this as `<group-id>` in subsequent group API calls. |

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Create a group with initial members and no invitation email**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/groups HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={"groupName":"Finance Team","emailIds":["alice@acme.com","bob@acme.com"]}
```

**Case 2 — Create a group with a description and send an invitation email**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/groups HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={"groupName":"Analytics Team","groupDesc":"Cross-functional analytics stakeholders","emailIds":["carol@acme.com","dave@acme.com"],"inviteMail":true,"mailSubject":"You've been added to the Analytics Team group","mailMessage":"Hi,<br>You now have access to the Analytics workspace group. Please log in to view your shared reports."}
```

**Case 3 — Client Portal: create a group scoped to a portal domain**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/groups HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={"groupName":"Portal Analysts","emailIds":["portal.user1@client.com","portal.user2@client.com"],"domainName":"reports.clientbrand.com","inviteMail":true}
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 200 OK** — Group created successfully.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Create group",
  "data": {
    "groupId": "320862000000295001"
  }
}
```

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Create Group](../../../sdk-examples/users-and-groups/workspace-groups/create-group.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **`domainName` is set at creation only** | Once a group is created with a `domainName`, that portal domain association cannot be changed. To change the domain, delete the group and recreate it. |
| **Omitting `domainName`** | Creates an org-wide group. All workspace users (regardless of portal domain) can be added as members. |
| **`emailIds` members at creation** | These users are added as initial group members. The same email appearing multiple times is handled as a single addition. |
| **`inviteMail=true` does not block creation** | If email delivery fails, the group and its members are still created. Email failures do not roll back the operation. |
| **Response** | Only the new `groupId` is returned. Use Get Group Details to retrieve the full group record. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | Workspace not found. | Verify `<workspace-id>`. |
| [7282](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7282) | 400 | A group with the same name already exists in this workspace. Group names must be unique per workspace. | Choose a different name for the group. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | User is not a Workspace Admin, Account Admin, or Organization Admin of the workspace. | Ensure the caller has at least Workspace Admin access. |
| [8060](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8060) | 400 | The specified `domainName` does not exist. | Provide a valid client portal domain name configured for the org. |
| [8061](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8061) | 400 | The specified `domainName` does not belong to the org's Account Admin. | Use a domain administered by the Account Admin of this organisation. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token with scope `ZohoAnalytics.share.create`. |
