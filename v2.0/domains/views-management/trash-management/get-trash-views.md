# Summary

**GET `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/trash`** - Get Trash Views (Trash Management / Views Management).

> This API has no `CONFIG` parameter. All inputs are provided via URL path parameters.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Returns the list of all views available in the trash of the specified workspace, along with the time each view was deleted and the user who deleted it.

The scope of the list depends on the caller. Account Admins, Organization Admins and Workspace Admins receive every trashed view in the workspace, while shared users and group members receive only the views they owned before deletion.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- This API has no CONFIG parameter. The only input is the **workspace-id** path parameter.
- Account Admins, Organization Admins and Workspace Admins see every trashed view in the workspace. Shared users and group members see only the views they owned before deletion.
- An empty **views** array is returned when the trash holds nothing visible to the calling user.
- **deletedTime** is an epoch timestamp in milliseconds returned as a string. Divide it by 1000 to obtain epoch seconds.
- **tabParentId**, **tabParentName** and **tabPosition** are returned only for views whose **viewType** is DashTab.
- **isDisabled** is returned only when it is true. It marks a view that cannot be restored under the current plan, typically a Live Connect report.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Case 3 — Multiple trashed views of different types**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "get trash view list",
  "data": {
    "views": [
      {
        "viewId": "7617000032567465",
        "viewName": "Sales",
        "viewType": "Table",
        "deletedTime": "1682432425829",
        "deletedBy": "admin@example.com"
      },
      {

        "viewName": "Region_vs_sales",
        "viewType": "AnalysisView",
        "deletedTime": "1682432425829",
        "deletedBy": "admin@example.com"
      },
      {
        "viewId": "7617000032567467",
        "viewName": "product_Vs_sales",
        "viewType": "AnalysisView",
        "deletedTime": "1682432425829",

        "deletedBy": "orgadmin@example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Case 4 — Shared user: returns empty (shared users only see views they owned)**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "get trash view list",
  "data": {
    "views": []
  }
}
```

**Case 5 — Trash list including a dashboard tab (`DashTab` type)**

Dashboard tabs have additional fields: `tabParentId`, `tabParentName`, `tabPosition`. These fields are present **only** for views with `viewType: "DashTab"`.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "get trash view list",
  "data": {
    "views": [
      {
        "viewId": "7617000032567701",
        "viewName": "Q1 Summary",
        "viewType": "DashTab",
        "deletedTime": "1682432427100",
        "deletedBy": "admin@example.com",
        "tabParentId": "7617000032567700",
        "tabParentName": "Annual Report Dashboard",
        "tabPosition": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Case 6 — List with a `isDisabled` flag (live connect view on unsupported plan)**

When a trashed view is a Live Connect report and the current plan does not support restoring it, the view appears in the list with `isDisabled: true`. Attempting to restore it will fail.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "get trash view list",
  "data": {
    "views": [
      {
        "viewId": "7617000032567800",
        "viewName": "Live_Sales_Report",
        "viewType": "AnalysisView",
        "deletedTime": "1682432428000",
        "deletedBy": "admin@example.com",
        "isDisabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
