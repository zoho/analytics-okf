# Summary

**GET `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/views/{view-id}/publish`** - Get View URL (View Operations / Views Management).

Generates and returns the publicly accessible URL for a view. The URL can be opened directly in a browser without authentication, allowing the view to be shared externally. The URL reflects any visual customisations specified in CONFIG (theme, toolbar, legend position, etc.) and optionally applies a data filter via `criteria`.

> **Two URL forms are returned depending on whether the view has a private key configured:**
> - **Public URL:** `https://analytics.zoho.com/open-view/<view-id>?ZDB_THEME_NAME=<theme>` — accessible by anyone with the link.
> - **Private key URL:** `https://analytics.zoho.com/open-view/<view-id>/<private-key>?ZDB_THEME_NAME=<theme>` — only accessible to users who also possess the private key.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.embed.read`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{view-id}` | string | ID of the view. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#view-id) |

## CONFIG Parameter

The CONFIG parameter is optional. When provided, it is a JSON object passed as a **query parameter** named `CONFIG`.

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `theme` | String | No | `"blue"` | The visual theme applied to the view in the URL. The theme name is appended as `?ZDB_THEME_NAME=<theme>` in the generated URL. Common values: `blue` (default), `bluedark`, `grey`, `green`, `violet`, `fire`, `tango`, `contrast`. |
| `includeTitle` | Boolean | No | `true` | When `true` (default): the view title is rendered in the shared page. When `false`: the title bar is hidden, giving more vertical space to the view content. |
| `includeDesc` | Boolean | No | `true` | When `true` (default): the view description is shown below the title. When `false`: the description is hidden. |
| `includeToolBar` | Boolean | No | `false` | When `false` (default): the toolbar (which includes export, share, and other action buttons) is hidden for a cleaner read-only appearance. When `true`: the toolbar is shown, allowing the viewer to interact with export and other toolbar functions. |
| `includeSearchBox` | Boolean | No | `false` | **Applies to Tables and Tabular Views only. Ignored for charts, pivots, dashboards.** When `false` (default): no search box is shown. When `true`: a search/filter box is shown above the table, allowing viewers to perform keyword searches within the displayed data. |
| `includeDatatypeSymbol` | Boolean | No | `false` | **Applies to Tables and Tabular Views only.** When `false` (default): column headers show only the column name. When `true`: a data type symbol (icon) is displayed next to each column name, helping viewers understand the column type (text, number, date, etc.) at a glance. |
| `includeShowHideOption` | Boolean | No | `false` | **Applies to Tables and Tabular Views only.** When `false` (default): viewers cannot toggle column visibility. When `true`: a column visibility toggle button appears, allowing viewers to show or hide specific columns without needing edit access. |
| `legendPosition` | String | No | `null` (view default) | **Applies to Chart (Analysis) Views only. Ignored for tables, dashboards, pivots.** Controls where the chart legend is placed. Allowed values: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `hidden` (no legend), `float` (overlay on chart). When omitted, the position configured in the view's saved settings is used. |
| `criteria` | String | No | `null` | A Zoho Analytics filter criteria string applied as a data filter on the URL. Filters the data shown when the URL is opened — the viewer sees only the filtered subset. Example: `"\"Region\"='East'"`. The criteria is encoded and appended as a `CRITERIA` URL parameter. When omitted, all data is shown. The criteria must reference columns that exist in the view. |
| `withCustomDomain` | Boolean | No | `false` | When `false` (default): the URL uses the standard `analytics.zoho.com` domain. When `true`: if the workspace has a custom client portal domain configured, the URL is generated using that custom domain instead. Requires the workspace to have a custom domain set up; if not configured, request fails with error **8062**. Use `domainName` for explicit domain specification instead of this flag when possible. |
| `domainName` | String | No | `null` | Explicitly specifies the custom domain to use in the generated URL. When provided, takes precedence over `withCustomDomain`. Must be a valid custom domain configured for the workspace. If the specified domain does not exist, request fails with error **8060**. If the domain exists but does not belong to the workspace/user, fails with error **8061**. |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- The CONFIG parameter is optional. Without it, the URL is generated with the default theme and the default display settings. As this is a GET request, the value must be stringified and URL encoded before it is sent.
- The generated URL opens directly in a browser without authentication, which is what makes the view shareable outside Zoho Analytics.
- When the view is made public with a private key, the key is embedded in the URL path as **/open-view/<view-id>/<private-key>**. Such a URL is reachable only by someone holding the key, and opening it without the key segment returns an access-denied page.
- **includeSearchBox**, **includeDatatypeSymbol** and **includeShowHideOption** apply to Tables and Tabular Views only. They are silently ignored for charts, pivot tables and dashboards.
- **legendPosition** applies to chart, or analysis, views only and is silently ignored for tables, pivot tables and dashboards. When it is omitted, the legend position saved in the view's own settings is used.
- **criteria** must reference columns that exist in the view. A column that does not exist fails filter criteria validation before the URL is generated.
- **domainName** takes precedence over **withCustomDomain** and is the preferred way to select a custom domain. A domain that does not exist fails with error 8060, and one that exists but does not belong to the workspace or the calling user fails with error 8061.
- **withCustomDomain** as true on a workspace that has no custom domain configured fails with error 8062. Configure the domain first, or omit the attribute to use the standard domain.
- Passing a tabbed dashboard generates a URL for the dashboard as a whole, and the display attributes apply to the dashboard frame. Configuring an individual tab is not exposed through this API.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

# Examples

## Sample Requests

GET /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/views/466206000000105001/publish?CONFIG={"theme":"green","includeTitle":true,"includeDesc":false,"includeToolBar":false,"criteria":"\"Region\"='East'"} HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

**Case 3 — Table URL with search box and data type symbols**

```http
GET /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/views/466206000000105003/publish?CONFIG={"includeSearchBox":true,"includeDatatypeSymbol":true,"includeShowHideOption":true} HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 200 OK**

**Case 1 — Standard public URL**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Get view URL",
  "data": {
    "viewUrl": "https://analytics.zoho.com/open-view/466206000000105001?ZDB_THEME_NAME=blue"
  }
}
```

**Case 2 — URL with green theme and region filter**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Get view URL",
  "data": {
    "viewUrl": "https://analytics.zoho.com/open-view/466206000000105001?ZDB_THEME_NAME=green&INCLUDEDESC=false&CRITERIA=%22Region%22%3D%27East%27"
  }
}
```

**Case 3 — View with private key configured (requires key in URL to access)**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Get view URL",
  "data": {
    "viewUrl": "https://analytics.zoho.com/open-view/466206000000105001/d7f69c7581b1974af438b42c4aaaed98?ZDB_THEME_NAME=blue"
  }
}
```

> **Difference between Case 1 and Case 3:** When a view's public access is configured with a private key (Make Public with key), the key is embedded in the URL path. This URL is only accessible to users who have the correct key. Without the key segment, the URL returns an access-denied page.

| Response Field | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| `data.viewUrl` | String | The complete, ready-to-use URL. Open this directly in a browser. The URL includes all visual customisations and filter criteria as query parameters. |
