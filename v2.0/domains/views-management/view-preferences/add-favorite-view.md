# Summary

**POST `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/views/{view-id}/favorite`** - Add Favourite View (View Preferences / Views Management).

> This API has no CONFIG parameter. All inputs are provided via URL path parameters only.

From the OpenAPI specification:

Marks the specified view as a favorite for the authenticated user.

The favorite status is a per-user preference - marking a view as a favorite does not change what any other user sees. Once the view is marked, the `isFavorite` field returned by the listing APIs such as Get All Dashboards and Get Shared Dashboards reads `true` for the same user.

The call is idempotent. Marking a view that the user has already marked as a favorite succeeds silently without raising an error.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.update`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{view-id}` | string | ID of the view. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#view-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- The favorite status is stored per user. Marking or unmarking a view has no effect on any other user's preferences.
- The authenticated user must have at least Read Only permission on the view. Account Admins, Organization Admins, Workspace Admins and view owners qualify by default.
- Any view type the user can access can be marked as a favorite - Tables, Analysis Views, Pivot Tables, Summary Views, Query Tables and Dashboards.
- This API has no CONFIG parameter. The only inputs are the **workspace-id** and **view-id** path parameters, so no Content-Type header is required.
- The API is idempotent and returns HTTP 204 No Content with an empty body on success.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `204 No Content`. The response has no body; treat the status code alone as success. Failures still return the JSON error envelope described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Mark a chart view as favourite**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/views/466206000000105001/favorite HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

**Case 2 — Mark a dashboard as favourite**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/views/466206000000106002/favorite HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 204 No Content** — No response body is returned on success.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Add Favourite View](../../../sdk-examples/views-management/view-preferences/add-favorite-view.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

- Adds the specified view to the **favourites list of the authenticated user**.
- Has no effect on other users' favourite preferences.
- If the view is already marked as a favourite by this user, the call succeeds silently (idempotent — no error is raised).
- The resulting `isFavorite: true` value is reflected in listing API responses (e.g., Get All Dashboards, Get Shared Dashboards) for the same user.

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | Workspace not found. | Verify the `<workspace-id>` in the URL is correct and accessible. |
| [7104](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7104) | 404 | View not found. | Verify the `<view-id>` exists in the specified workspace. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | User does not have permission to mark this view as a favourite. | Ensure the user has at least Read Only permission on the view. |
| [7319](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7319) | 400 | The specified view does not belong to the specified workspace. | Ensure both `<workspace-id>` and `<view-id>` are consistent and correct. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | Invalid OAuth token. | Provide a valid, non-expired token with scope `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.update`. |
