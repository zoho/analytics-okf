# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | The ID of the workspace. It can be obtained using any of the workspace list APIs. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- Workspace Admins receive every folder of the workspace. Shared users and group members receive a filtered list holding only the folders that contain at least one view they have access to. When a view inside a sub-folder is accessible to the user, both the sub-folder and its parent folder are included.
- The folders array is returned empty when the workspace holds no folder, or when the requesting user has access to no view in the workspace.
- The parentFolderId is always returned as a quoted string and not as a number. The value -1 indicates that the folder is at the root level and has no parent.
- The folders are sorted by folderIndex within their hierarchy level. The default folder always holds folderIndex as -1.
- Exactly one folder of a workspace holds isDefault as true at any point in time.
- Exactly one level of nesting is supported. A root level folder can hold sub-folders, and a sub-folder cannot hold children of its own.
- This API is the entry point for all the other folder APIs. The folderId values returned here are used as the folder-id in the request URL of the Rename Folder, Delete Folder, Change Folder Hierarchy, Change Folder Position and Make Default Folder APIs, as the parentFolderId in the Create Folder and Change Folder Hierarchy APIs, as the referenceFolderId in the Change Folder Position API, and as the folderId in the Move Views To Folder API.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `200` with content type `application/json`. JSON responses use the standard envelope `{ "status": "success", "summary": ..., "data": {...} }` described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `folderId` | String | Unique ID of the folder. |
| `folderName` | String | Display name of the folder. |
| `folderDesc` | String | Description of the folder. Empty string if none set. |
| `folderIndex` | Integer | Sort position of the folder within its level. `-1` indicates the default folder. |
| `isDefault` | Boolean | `true` if this is the workspace's current default folder. |
| `parentFolderId` | String | ID of the parent folder. `"-1"` means the folder is at the top level (root). |

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Get Folder List](../../../sdk-examples/workspace-management/workspace-folders/get-folders.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Filtered response for shared users** | Workspace Admins see all folders. Shared Users and Group Members receive only folders that contain at least one view they can access. If a user can access a view inside a sub-folder, both the sub-folder and its parent folder are included in their response. |
| **`parentFolderId` is a string** | Returned as a quoted string (e.g. `"-1"`), not a numeric. `"-1"` means the folder is at root level with no parent. |
| **`folderIndex` ordering** | Folders are sorted by `folderIndex` within their level. The default folder always has `folderIndex: -1`. |
| **Empty workspace** | If the workspace has no folders, the `folders` array is returned empty (`[]`). |
| **Dependency for other APIs** | The `folderId` values returned here are required as: `<folder-id>` in the URL for Rename Folder, Delete Folder, Change Folder Hierarchy, Change Folder Position, and Make Default Folder; `parentFolderId` in Create Folder; `referenceFolderId` in Change Folder Position. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | User does not have permission. | Ensure the user is a Workspace Admin, or has at least READ access to one or more views in the workspace. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | The OAuth access token is missing, expired, revoked, or does not carry the scope required by this operation. | Regenerate the access token with the required scope (see the endpoint document) and retry. |
