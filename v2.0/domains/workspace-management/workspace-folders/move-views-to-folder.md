# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.update`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |
| `Content-Type` | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Required | The CONFIG JSON is sent as a form field named `CONFIG`. |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | The ID of the workspace. It can be obtained using any of the workspace list APIs. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Default | Max Items | Description |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `folderId` | Long | Yes | — | — | ID of the destination folder. |
| `viewIds` | JSONArray of Long | Yes | — | 1000 | Array of view IDs to move into the destination folder. |

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- Move Views To Folder returns a bare HTTP 204 No Content on success. There is no response body and no **status** or **summary** JSON to parse, so check only the HTTP status code. A JSON payload is returned only on failure.
- This operation is transactional. Either all the specified views are moved or none of them are. A single view ID that does not belong to the workspace fails the entire request with error code 7319 before any view is moved.
- A maximum of 1000 view IDs can be moved in a single request. Split the operation into multiple requests when more views have to be moved.
- The destination folder can be a root level folder or a sub-folder.
- There is no restriction on the type of the view. Tables, reports and dashboards can all be moved.
- The folderId should be obtained using the Get Folder List API, and the viewIds should be obtained using the Get View List API for the workspace.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `204 No Content`. The response has no body; treat the status code alone as success. Failures still return the JSON error envelope described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

Not applicable — this API never returns a JSON body on success (HTTP 204 No Content). Only failure responses contain a JSON error payload.

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Move a single view to a folder**

```http
PUT /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/views/movetofolder HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={"folderId":7617000071955001,"viewIds":[7617000000510001]}
```

**Case 2 — Move multiple views to a folder in bulk**

```http
PUT /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/views/movetofolder HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={"folderId":7617000071955001,"viewIds":[7617000000510001,7617000000510002,7617000000510003]}
```

**Case 3 — White label portal user moving views to a folder**

```http
PUT /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/views/movetofolder HTTP/1.1
Host: portal.customdomain.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.cccccc.dddddd
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

CONFIG={"folderId":7617000071955001,"viewIds":[7617000000510004,7617000000510005]}
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 204 No Content**

This API returns **no response body** on success — only an HTTP `204 No Content` status. There is no JSON payload to parse on success; check only the HTTP status code.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Move Views To Folder](../../../sdk-examples/workspace-management/workspace-folders/move-views-to-folder.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Success response has no body** | Move Views To Folder returns a bare HTTP `204 No Content` on success — no `status`/`summary` JSON to parse. |
| **Transactional — all or nothing** | Either all specified views are moved, or none. A single invalid `viewId` (not belonging to the workspace) causes the entire request to fail with error 7319 before any views are moved. |
| **Maximum 1000 views per request** | For workspaces requiring more than 1000 moves, split into multiple calls. |
| **Destination can be any level** | Views can be moved to both root-level folders and sub-folders. |
| **No restriction on view type** | Tables, reports, and dashboards can all be moved. |
| **Dependency** | `folderId` must be obtained from Get Folder List. `viewIds` must be obtained from the Get View List API for the workspace. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7144](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7144) | 400 | The specified destination folder does not exist. | Verify the `folderId` using the Get Folder List API. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | User does not have permission. | Ensure the user is a Workspace Admin or has Create Folder permission on the workspace. |
| [7319](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7319) | 400 | One or more view IDs do not belong to the specified workspace. | Ensure all view IDs in `viewIds` belong to the workspace identified by `<workspace-id>`. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | The OAuth access token is missing, expired, revoked, or does not carry the scope required by this operation. | Regenerate the access token with the required scope (see the endpoint document) and retry. |
