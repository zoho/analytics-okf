- The result of this API is a subset of the result of the Get All Workspace List API.
- The scope is resolved from the identity of the requesting user. The **ZANALYTICS-ORGID** header is not required for this API.

| `workspaces[].workspaceId` | String | Unique workspace identifier. |
| `workspaces[].workspaceName` | String | Workspace display name. |
| `workspaces[].workspaceDesc` | String | Description. Empty string if not set. |
| `workspaces[].orgId` | String | Organisation ID of the workspace owner (not the caller's org). |
| `workspaces[].createdTime` | String | Unix timestamp (milliseconds) of workspace creation. |
| `workspaces[].createdBy` | String | Email of the user who created the workspace. |

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Returns workspaces from other orgs** | This API returns workspaces that have been shared with the calling user by users from other organisations. Workspaces within the caller's own org are not included. |
| **`ZANALYTICS-ORGID` not required** | The scope is cross-org and determined from the caller's identity, not an org header. |
| **Relationship to Get All Workspace List** | The results of this API are a subset of what Get All Workspace List returns (the shared-from-other-orgs portion). |
| **Dependency** | No dependencies on other APIs for the request. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token with scope `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.read`. |
