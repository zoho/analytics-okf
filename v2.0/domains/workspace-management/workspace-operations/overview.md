# Summary

These APIs manage the lifecycle and metadata of workspaces — creating, copying, renaming, deleting, and inspecting workspaces. They also provide mechanisms to retrieve workspace access keys for cross-organisation operations, list workspaces accessible to a user, and export a workspace's structure as a reusable template.

> **Workspace:** A workspace is the top-level container in Zoho Analytics that holds tables, reports, dashboards, and sharing configurations. All data and views exist within a workspace.

# API-Specific Notes and Behaviours

## Workspace Name Constraints

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Max length | 50 characters for `workspaceName` / `newWorkspaceName`. Exceeding this is rejected at parameter validation. |
| Uniqueness | Workspace names must be unique within the organisation. Creating or renaming to a duplicate name fails with error **7111**. |
| Description max | 250 characters. Exceeding this is rejected at parameter validation. |
| Description reset | In Rename Workspace, omitting `workspaceDesc` **clears the existing description** to empty string. Always include the current description to preserve it. |

## Create Workspace

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Plan workspace limit reached | Fails with error **7951**. The limit depends on the organisation's subscription tier. |
| Org Admin calling this API | Allowed — Org Admins can create workspaces within their organisation. |
| Workspace created with no views | The workspace is usable but empty. Tables and views must be added via separate APIs. |

## Copy Workspace

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Same-org copy without `workspaceKey` | Allowed — `workspaceKey` is only checked for cross-org copies. |
| Account Admin cross-org copy | Set `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` to the destination org ID. Provide `workspaceKey` (source workspace's secret key). The caller must be an Account Admin or Org Admin of the destination org. |
| Org Admin cross-org copy using `ZANALYTICS-DEST-ORGID` | Set `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` to the caller's own (source) org and `ZANALYTICS-DEST-ORGID` to the destination org. The system validates the caller is a member of the destination org. `workspaceKey` is still required because the destination org differs from the source workspace's org. |
| `ZANALYTICS-DEST-ORGID` refers to a non-existent org | Fails with error **8058** before any copy begins. |
| Caller is not a member of the org specified in `ZANALYTICS-DEST-ORGID` | Fails with error **7301** — "not authorised to do this operation." |
| Cross-org copy without `workspaceKey` | Fails with error **8024**. |
| Provided `workspaceKey` does not match source workspace's secret key | Fails with error **8024**. Obtain the correct key from Get Workspace Secret Key. |
| `copyWithData=true` on a large workspace | Operation takes significantly longer. The rate limit (1 concurrent copy per org) means other copy requests will queue or fail while this is in progress. |
| `copyWithImportSource=false` (default) | Tables in the copy will have no import source — data must be re-imported or manually entered. The table schema is preserved. |
| `copyWithImportSource=true` with a live database connection | Live/direct database connections (e.g., Zoho DataPrep live links) cannot be copied by definition — only import-based connections (scheduled syncs, file imports, API-pushed data) are preserved. Live connections require manual reconnection. |
| `newWorkspaceDesc` omitted | The copied workspace has an empty description. The source workspace's description is not automatically copied. |
| Destination org plan limit | Fails with error **7951** if the destination org has reached its workspace limit. |
| Concurrent copy in progress | Only one copy per org runs at a time. A simultaneous request is rejected. |

## Rename Workspace

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Renaming to the same name | Succeeds (idempotent). |
| Renaming to a name already in use in the org | Fails with error **7111**. |
| `workspaceDesc` omitted from request | Description is permanently cleared to empty string — existing description is lost. Always include `workspaceDesc` if you only intend to change the name. |

## Delete Workspace

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Workspace has active import jobs | Import jobs are cancelled. The workspace and all its data are deleted. |
| Workspace is shared with users | All sharing configurations are removed. Users who had access to views in this workspace will lose all access immediately. |
| Workspace has Workspace Admins | Their admin role for this workspace is removed when the workspace is deleted. Their org membership is not affected. |
| Deletion is permanent | There is no trash/recycle mechanism for workspaces. Once deleted, the workspace and all its content cannot be recovered. |

## Export as Template

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `viewIds` is an empty array | Rejected — at least one view ID must be provided. |
| A view ID belongs to a different workspace | Fails with error **7319**. All view IDs must be in the same workspace as specified in the URL. |
| Views with lookup columns | Dependent tables needed to resolve lookups are automatically included in the template. |
| Response format | The response is a binary `.atpt` file, not JSON. Clients must handle the response as a binary stream and save it to disk. |

## Get Workspace Secret Key

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `regenerateKey=false` (default) | Returns the existing key. If no key has been generated yet, the system generates and returns one. |
| `regenerateKey=true` | Generates a new key. The old key is permanently invalidated. Any cross-org copy that was in progress using the old key is not affected (the key is validated only at copy start), but any future copy attempts using the old key will fail. |
| Who can see the key | Only Account Admins and Org Admins of the workspace's organisation. The key is never returned in workspace listing or info APIs. |

## Get Workspace Info — `withUserRoleInfo`

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `withUserRoleInfo=false` (default) | Standard metadata only. Fastest response. |
| `withUserRoleInfo=true` — Account Admin caller | `roleName` returns `"Account Admin"`, `roleId` is `0`, `isCustomRoleUser` is `false`. |
| `withUserRoleInfo=true` — Org Admin caller | `roleName` returns `"Organization Admin"`, `roleId` is `0`. |
| `withUserRoleInfo=true` — custom role user | `isCustomRoleUser` is `true`, `roleId` is the custom role's numeric ID, `roleName` is the custom role's display name. |
| `withUserRoleInfo=true` — shared user (no workspace role) | `roleName` may reflect their view-level access role. Behaviour depends on their permission level. |

## Workspace List API Comparison

| API | Returns | Who can call | ZANALYTICS-ORGID |
|-----|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Get All Workspace List | Owned + shared workspaces for the caller | Any user | Not required |
| Get Owned Workspace List | All workspaces in the caller's org | Account Admin only | Not required |
| Get Shared Workspace List | Workspaces from other orgs shared with the caller | Any user | Not required |
| Get Workspace Info | Single workspace details | Workspace Admin, shared user, or any user with view access | Not required |
