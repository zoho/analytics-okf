# Summary

**POST `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/default`** - Add Default Workspace (Workspace Preferences / Workspace Management).

Marks the specified workspace as the calling user's default workspace. The default workspace is the one that opens automatically when the user logs in to Zoho Analytics.

A user can have only one default workspace at a time. If the user already has a different workspace set as default, that previous default is silently replaced — no error is raised. Calling this API on a workspace that is already the user's default succeeds without error (idempotent).

> This API has no CONFIG parameter and no request body.

# Endpoint

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Operation ID | `addDefaultWorkspace` |
| HTTP method | POST |
| URL | `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/default` |
| Base URL | `https://analyticsapi.zoho.com` (data-center specific, see [Data centers](../../../foundations/data-centers.md)) |
| OAuth scope | [`ZohoAnalytics.metadata.update`](../../../foundations/oauth-scopes.md#zohoanalyticsmetadataupdate) |
| ZANALYTICS-ORGID header | **Required** - Organisation ID of the workspace. |
| Permission required | The authenticated user must be a Workspace Admin, or a Shared User, or a Group Member of the workspace, or any user with at least Read permission on a view within the workspace. See [Roles & permissions](../../../foundations/roles-and-permissions.md). |
| CONFIG parameter | No CONFIG parameter |
| Success response | HTTP 204 with no body |

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.update`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | The ID of the workspace. It can be obtained using any of the workspace list APIs. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- Add Default Workspace returns a bare HTTP 204 No Content on success. There is no response body and no **status** or **summary** JSON to parse, so check only the HTTP status code. A JSON payload is returned only on failure.
- A user can hold only one default workspace at a time. When the user already holds a different workspace as the default, the previous default is replaced silently and no error is raised.
- This API is idempotent. Invoking it on a workspace that is already the default workspace of the user succeeds without error and makes no change.
- The requesting user should have at least one view of the workspace shared with them. A user with no access to any view of the workspace cannot mark it as the default workspace and the request fails with error code 7301.
- The default preference continues to be stored even when the user loses access to the workspace later. However, the workspace is not presented as accessible until the access is restored.
- After this API is invoked, the workspace is returned with isDefault as true in the response of the Get All Workspace List and the Get Shared Workspace List APIs. Use those APIs to verify the change.
- The preferences are stored per user and per organization. Marking a workspace as the default for one user has no effect on the preferences of any other user.
- Client Portal users and standard Zoho Analytics users maintain separate preference stores, even when they access the same workspace. A Client Portal user should access the workspace through the portal domain in which it is shared with them, failing which the access check fails with error code 7301.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `204 No Content`. The response has no body; treat the status code alone as success. Failures still return the JSON error envelope described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

Not applicable — this API never returns a JSON body on success (HTTP 204 No Content). Only failure responses contain a JSON error payload.

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Mark a workspace as default (Account Admin)**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/default HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

**Case 2 — Shared user setting their default workspace**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/default HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.aaaaaa.bbbbbb
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

**Case 3 — Client Portal user setting their default workspace (via portal domain)**

```http
POST /restapi/v2/workspaces/38190000004180410/default HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.cccccc.dddddd
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 57058019
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 204 No Content**

This API returns **no response body** on success — only an HTTP `204 No Content` status. There is no JSON payload to parse on success; check only the HTTP status code.

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Add Default Workspace](../../../sdk-examples/workspace-management/workspace-preferences/add-default-workspace.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Success response has no body** | Add Default Workspace returns a bare HTTP `204 No Content` on success — no `status`/`summary` JSON to parse. |
| **Replaces any existing default silently** | If the user already has a different workspace set as default, the previous default is replaced without error. Only one default workspace is allowed per user. |
| **Idempotent** | Calling this API with the workspace that is already the user's default succeeds without error and makes no change. |
| **Access requirement** | The user must have at least one view shared with them in the workspace (i.e. any path to the workspace). Users with no access to any view in the workspace cannot set it as default (error 7301). |
| **No CONFIG or request body** | The workspace is identified solely by `<workspace-id>` in the URL. |
| **`isDefault` flag in list responses** | After calling this API, the workspace appears with `isDefault: true` in Get All Workspace List and Get Shared Workspace List responses. Use those APIs to verify the change. |
| **Dependency** | `<workspace-id>` → Get All Workspace List or Get Shared Workspace List. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | Workspace not found. | Verify `<workspace-id>`. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | The user has no access to the specified workspace — no views have been shared with them, and they are not a Workspace Admin. | Ensure the user is a workspace member or has at least one view shared with them before marking it as default. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token with scope `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.update`. |
