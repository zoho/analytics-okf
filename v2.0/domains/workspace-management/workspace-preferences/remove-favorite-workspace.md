| OpenAPI | [`workspace-management-grouped-api.json`](../../../references/openapi/workspace-management-grouped-api.json) - pointer `#/paths/~1restapi~1v2~1workspaces~1{workspace-id}~1favorite/delete` |

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.update`. See [Authentication](../../../foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](../../organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](../../../foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | The ID of the workspace. It can be obtained using any of the workspace list APIs. | [How to obtain](../../../foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- Remove Favourite Workspace returns a bare HTTP 204 No Content on success. There is no response body and no **status** or **summary** JSON to parse, so check only the HTTP status code. A JSON payload is returned only on failure.
- This API is idempotent. When the workspace is not present in the favourites of the user, the request succeeds silently without error.
- This behaviour differs from the Remove Default Workspace API, which fails with error code 7415 when the workspace is not the current default. This is the key behavioural difference between the two remove operations.
- The requesting user should have at least one view of the workspace shared with them, failing which the request fails with error code 7301.
- The preferences are stored per user and per organization. Removing a workspace from the favourites of one user has no effect on the preferences of any other user.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `204 No Content`. The response has no body; treat the status code alone as success. Failures still return the JSON error envelope described in [Response envelope](../../../foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

Not applicable — this API never returns a JSON body on success (HTTP 204 No Content). Only failure responses contain a JSON error payload.

# Examples

## Sample Requests

**Case 1 — Remove a workspace from favourites**

```http
DELETE /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/favorite HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

**Case 2 — Shared user removing a workspace from their favourites**

```http
DELETE /restapi/v2/workspaces/466206000000071000/favorite HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.aaaaaa.bbbbbb
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

**Case 3 — Client Portal user removing a workspace from their favourites**

```http
DELETE /restapi/v2/workspaces/38190000004180410/favorite HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.cccccc.dddddd
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 57058019
```

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 204 No Content**

This API returns **no response body** on success — only an HTTP `204 No Content` status. There is no JSON payload to parse on success; check only the HTTP status code.

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Remove Favourite Workspace](../../../sdk-examples/workspace-management/workspace-preferences/remove-favorite-workspace.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](../../../foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Success response has no body** | Remove Favourite Workspace returns a bare HTTP `204 No Content` on success — no `status`/`summary` JSON to parse. |
| **Idempotent — no error if not in favourites** | Unlike Remove Default Workspace (which fails with 7415 if not set as default), this API silently succeeds even if the workspace is not currently in the user's favourites. |
| **Contrast with Remove Default Workspace** | Remove Default Workspace is NOT idempotent; Remove Favourite Workspace IS idempotent. This is the key behavioural asymmetry between the two "remove" operations. |
| **No CONFIG or request body** | The workspace is identified solely by `<workspace-id>` in the URL. |
| **Dependency** | `<workspace-id>` → Get All Workspace List or Get Shared Workspace List. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](../../../foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | Workspace not found. | Verify `<workspace-id>`. |
| [7301](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | The user has no access to the specified workspace. | Ensure the user has at least one view shared with them in the workspace. |
| [8535](../../../foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token with scope `ZohoAnalytics.metadata.update`. |
