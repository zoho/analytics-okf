# Summary

One row per error code. Follow the code link for the full entry with per-operation reasons, solutions and the operations that raise it. Failure envelope: `{"status":"failure","summary":"<CONSTANT>","data":{"errorCode":<int>,"errorMessage":"..."}}`. HTTP status is "observed" from documented samples or "typical" for the code family. See [Error code catalog](error-codes.md) and [HTTP status codes](http-status-codes.md).
