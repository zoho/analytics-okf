# Summary

Authorization has two independent layers. Both must pass:

1. **OAuth scope** on the access token (see [OAuth scopes](oauth-scopes.md)). A missing scope fails with [`8535`](error-codes.md#error-8535).
2. **Role or permission** of the authenticated user on the organization, workspace or view (see [Roles & permissions](roles-and-permissions.md)). A missing permission fails with [`7301`](error-codes.md#error-7301) (`SECURITY_NOT_PERMITTED`).

The `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` column says whether the organization header is `required`, `optional` or `not-required` for the call.

A caller can hold a named permission through a direct share, a workspace role, or an organization-defined custom role - see [Custom roles](custom-roles.md).
