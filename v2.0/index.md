# Zoho Analytics REST API v2 - Open Knowledge Format bundle

Knowledge bundle covering every public Zoho Analytics REST API v2 endpoint, the conventions shared by all of them, and their error codes, scopes and permissions. Start with the overview, then the foundations, then the domain you need.

# Start Here

* [Zoho Analytics REST API v2 - overview](overview.md) - What the Zoho Analytics REST API v2 is, how it is organized into 10 domains and 168 endpoints, and the five conventions every call shares.
* [Endpoint catalog](endpoint-catalog.md) - All 168 Zoho Analytics REST API v2 endpoints in one table: method, path, operation ID, group, OAuth scope, success status and organization-header requirement.
* [How to use this bundle](how-to-use-this-bundle.md) - Structure of the Zoho Analytics REST API v2 OKF bundle, the frontmatter contract of each concept type, and navigation rules for AI assistants, SDK generators, Postman runners and MCP servers.

# Foundations (shared by every endpoint)

* [Authentication (OAuth 2.0)](foundations/authentication.md) - How to authenticate Zoho Analytics REST API v2 calls with OAuth 2.0 access tokens, the Authorization header format, token lifetime and refresh, and the errors returned when authentication fails.
* [Custom roles](foundations/custom-roles.md) - Organization-defined custom roles in Zoho Analytics - the three access permission levels, the full permission catalogue by category, how a custom role name is used by the REST API v2 user-management endpoints, and how its permissions map onto the API's authorization vocabulary.

* [Filter criteria syntax](foundations/filter-criteria-syntax.md) - Grammar and rules of the SQL-like criteria expression used by Zoho Analytics REST API v2 to filter rows in exports, row updates and deletes, shares, embed URLs, publish configurations and email schedules.
* [Glossary](foundations/glossary.md) - Definitions of every Zoho Analytics object and term used across the REST API v2 documentation - organization, workspace, view, table, query table, report, dashboard, column, lookup, formula, variable, datasource, job, share, publish, embed, slideshow, schedule, AutoML, portal and more.
* [HTTP status codes](foundations/http-status-codes.md) - Which HTTP status codes Zoho Analytics REST API v2 returns, what each one means, and how it maps to the application error codes in the failure envelope.
* [Identifiers and how to obtain them](foundations/identifiers.md) - Every identifier used in Zoho Analytics REST API v2 paths and headers (organization, workspace, view, column, job, schedule and more), its format, and the operations that return it.
* [Import options and enumerations](foundations/import-options-and-enums.md) - The CONFIG vocabulary shared by the Zoho Analytics REST API v2 import endpoints - importType modes, fileType, autoIdentify, onError, number separators, columnDataTypes, matchingColumns, payload limits, and the permission each mode needs.
* [OAuth scopes](foundations/oauth-scopes.md) - All Zoho Analytics OAuth 2.0 scopes, what each family covers, and which REST API v2 operations require each scope.
* [Permission matrix](foundations/permission-matrix.md) - For every Zoho Analytics REST API v2 operation: the OAuth scope, whether the organization header is needed, and the role or view permission the caller must hold.
* [Rate limits, throttling and quotas](foundations/rate-limits-and-quotas.md) - Per-operation request throttles, concurrency guards, plan-governed quotas and API unit consumption for the Zoho Analytics REST API v2.
* [Request conventions](foundations/request-conventions.md) - The rules shared by every Zoho Analytics REST API v2 request - URL structure, path placeholders, mandatory headers, the CONFIG parameter and how to encode it per HTTP method, multipart uploads, and idempotency.
* [Response envelope](foundations/response-envelope.md) - The JSON envelope returned by Zoho Analytics REST API v2 on success and failure, the 204 no-body pattern, file responses from export endpoints, and the value conventions inside data.
* [Roles and permissions](foundations/roles-and-permissions.md) - The authorization model of Zoho Analytics REST API v2 - organization roles, workspace roles, view-level share permissions, ownership, and how the "Permission Required" statements in endpoint documents should be read.
* [SDK clients and code samples](foundations/sdk-clients.md) - The official Zoho Analytics client libraries (Java, C#, Go, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby), the Deluge scripting pattern, how each client is constructed from OAuth credentials, and how to read the per-endpoint SDK example documents.
* [White Label and Client Portal](foundations/white-label-client-portal.md) - How Zoho Analytics White Label (Client Portal) custom domains interact with the REST API v2 - portal request hosts, the domainName attribute, workspace domain access, and which API families are allowed or blocked in a portal context.

# Workflows

* [Bootstrap: from access token to workspace and view IDs](workflows/bootstrap-identifiers.md) - The first three calls of every integration - list organizations, pick the org ID for the header, and resolve workspace and view names into the IDs that all other endpoints need.
* [Embed a view for many tenants with per-tenant row filters](workflows/embed-view-multi-tenant.md) - Mint one short-lived embed URL per end customer, each carrying its own criteria, permissions and column restrictions, then audit and revoke URLs.
* [Export a view, dashboard or SQL result asynchronously](workflows/export-data-asynchronously.md) - Create an export job, poll or receive a callback, and download the file - the path for dashboards, query tables, large tables and ad-hoc SQL that the synchronous export rejects.
* [Load data into a table (small, large and very large files)](workflows/import-large-dataset.md) - Choose between synchronous import, asynchronous import job and batch import, then create or fill a table and verify the result.
* [Add users to an organization and a workspace, and set their roles](workflows/manage-users-and-roles.md) - Invite users to the organization, place them in a workspace with a role, promote or demote admins, deactivate leavers, and understand who may perform each step.
* [Schedule a recurring email delivery of a report or dashboard](workflows/schedule-email-report.md) - Create an email schedule with recipients and calendar frequency, trigger it once to test, enable or disable it, and update it safely.
* [Share views with users or groups, with row and column restrictions](workflows/share-view-with-row-filter.md) - Grant a permission set on one or more views to users or a group, optionally limiting rows with criteria and columns with column lists, then inspect, update or revoke the share.
* [Train an AutoML model, deploy it and score a table](workflows/train-and-run-automl-model.md) - The end-to-end AutoML sequence - create an analysis on a training table, wait for models to train, deploy the best model, run predictions into an output table, and clean up.
