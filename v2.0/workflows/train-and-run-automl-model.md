# Goal

Produce predictions for a table using AutoML, from training to a populated output table.

# Prerequisites

- AutoML enabled for the organization and plan; all eleven endpoints are blocked from Client Portal hosts (`7301`).
- Caller is Account Admin, Organization Admin, or the Workspace Admin (owner) of the workspace. Get AutoML Analysis In Org is Account/Organization Admin only.
- `workspaceId` and the `trainingTableId` (a table's `viewId` from [Get View List](../domains/views-management/view-operations/get-views.md)).

# Steps

1. **Create the analysis** with [Create AutoML Analysis](../domains/dsml/automl/create-auto-ml-analysis.md) naming the training table and target column. Training starts immediately; one model per algorithm. Keep `analysisId` (`21000003` if the name already exists).
2. **Wait for training** by polling [Get AutoML Analysis Details](../domains/dsml/automl/get-auto-ml-analysis-details.md) until every `models[].trainingStatus` you care about is `Completed`. This is the **only** endpoint that returns `models[].id`; keep the `modelId` of the best model.
3. **(Optional) What-if** with [AutoML What If Analysis](../domains/dsml/automl/auto-ml-what-if-analysis.md) to get a one-off prediction from the model without storing anything (`21000043` while training).
4. **Deploy** with [Create AutoML Analysis Deployment](../domains/dsml/automl/create-auto-ml-analysis-deployment.md) giving the `modelId` and an `inputTableId`. Keep `deploymentId` and `outputTableId`. One deployment per model (`21000051`); a model still training (`21000052`) or failed (`21000053`) cannot be deployed.
5. **Run** with [Run AutoML Analysis](../domains/dsml/automl/run-auto-ml-analysis.md) using the `deploymentId`; predictions are written to the output table. Check status with [Get Deployments For A Model](../domains/dsml/automl/get-deployments-for-model.md).
6. **Read predictions** from the output table with the [export](export-data-asynchronously.md) or [row](../domains/data-operations/row-operations/overview.md) APIs.
7. **Clean up.** [Delete AutoML Analysis Model Deployment](../domains/dsml/automl/delete-auto-ml-analysis-model-deployment.md) removes only the deployment; [Delete AutoML Analysis Model](../domains/dsml/automl/delete-auto-ml-analysis-model.md) removes the model and its deployment; [Delete AutoML Analysis](../domains/dsml/automl/delete-auto-ml-analysis.md) removes the whole subtree. The output table is never deleted automatically; remove it with [Delete View](../domains/views-management/view-operations/delete-view.md).
